        <p>Overeating and obesity are caused by genetic, psychological and sociological factors. Some people are genetically prone to obesity, or in some people, internal gland diseases may cause obesity. From a psychological point of view, eating is usually a way to solve aggression or to solve emotional needs. Many times children who are neglected feel satisfied by eating too much food and getting fat. Sometimes overeating is a sign of a mental illness. In some societies obesity and health are synonymous. While in other societies, being thin means attractiveness and health. Your question is probably the cause of your family's obesity problem. In the family, the word " obesity" is used to describe people who have a lot of food and are fat. In fact, the opposite is true. In my family, everyone knows that the family members are fat and the children are thin. In our society, being fat means attractiveness, and in my family (especially in the north), being thin mean</p>

        <p>Since the beginning of our lives, we have common interests that help us to understand each other better. Of course, sometimes it is necessary to have common goals in life to achieve the best result, but common interests alone do not mean forgetting life. Sometimes it is true that some people are not able to handle life's problems and do not know how to deal with it. There are some psychologists who specialize in the field of interpersonal psychology and they try to understand the other party's life situation from the point of view of helping people with common goals. But since the field is not well known in the world and there are not many psychologists in the whole world, the number of psychologists and counselors is limited and the quality of their work is low. Psychologists in general are not known for their great knowledge and are not well versed in the art of interpersonal relationships. In the field related to interpersonal psychology, the quality and quantity of treatment and the success rate of such counselors is very low. In general, these people do not find the necessary skills to be of real help and are more concerned with the personal gain of the counselor and reaching the necessary result by getting help from the help of others. It is recommended to seek help from a non-specialist counselor in this field.</p>

Of course, these people mostly grew up in families where the stricter the standards, the more their children suffer from this success syndrome.

In these two years that you have been in this relationship, you did not do anything significant and you did nothing for yourself. You have been living with your parents and they have not encouraged you. You can't expect your parents to constantly support you, as parents do in most cases, and you should ask yourself what you expect from them. In fact, you should find a new and valuable path. This path may be a serious work that requires commitment and you may need to go through it with determination and strength, but you should not expect it. In general, it is better to evaluate yourself and review your performance and self-evaluations from the past. Get help from a counselor.</p>

Since I was a child, I had behaviors that were strange to me, for example, everything that falls on the ground must die, or everything around me must be equal. But I didn't know what the problem was. How long have you been reading books and content on the Peach website? I understood that these are obsessive problems. I raised the issue with my father's mother to go to a counselor because I was really tired. But they treated me very badly, especially my mother. Saying, don't repeat these things again, if you want, you can do it yourself. They started fighting and making fun of me. They have been sensitive to my behavior for a while now, and they were always complaining. They are just slowly forgetting. I don't want to talk to them about this issue anymore, I can't go to a counselor myself because now I'm dependent on my parents financially and transportation, and my parents are monitoring me in every way, in terms of talking to friends. I don't want to talk about this with anyone else, family or friends, I don't know if it's true or not, but I'm afraid that they will treat me badly. I just want to grow up a bit and then I will go to the counselor myself, but I had a question for you, I don't know if you can help me or not, but what should I do until this problem doesn't get worse and I can manage it?</p>

        <p>The best thing to do is to resolve the differences and make them face the consequences of their actions. Also, by supporting and correcting some behaviors, this will make the differences less acute and manageable. The type of treatment is up to the family. Sometimes, one of the parents may decide to intervene, and in these cases, the child's relationship with the parents must be strengthened and the parents can face the difficult conditions with patience and tolerance. The important thing is to remember that the child does not have the right to refuse an offer and be affected by the parents. He can decide to accept the parents' offer if he feels that he has made a wise decision. In these cases and cases, if the parents really have no other problem or there are other suitable options, resolve the issues and get rid of the reasons that cause the child discomfort. And get rid Of the situations that make the child anxious. For example, some children may be afraid of the edges of the road and do not like to go on the edges. So if the mother takes the child to the edge of the street to go and collect the children, the children's anxiety will decrease and they will be calm down. This does not mean that the continuation of these conditions will cause the children discomfort, but it is better to resolve these issues and face the hardships of adulthood with the help of a counselor.</p>

        <p>Dear Mrs. Doctor: In the first place, it is very effective. The role of the family in the child's life is very important and influential. This means that the family should have a positive and effective influence on the child through the school, literature, parenting and even the school itself. The type of literature, the level of drama in the familyoscopic theater, the amount of laughter and laughter in the children at the age of 6-7, the relationship with the parents and the type of relationship with them at the time of the movie, are all effective factors in the development of the child. For example, in a movie about love, a father and his wife love each other very much, and they make a movie that is very attractive to the child, and the child becomes interested in it, and after watching the movie The Last Airbender, he becomes depressed and cries for weeks. Or that he becomes anxious and changes from the normal child behavior to the aggressive and psychotic behavior of the parents. In this case, the child will have a severe disorder that is, if not treated, will last several years. In addition, the role model is important because the child is likely to take this movie seriously or to continue the movie. In the next step, after watching The LastAirbender, the children will be made aware of the special effects and the role they play in the movie and will be able to tell their roles and the consequences of their behavior. Thank you for your advice. Sincerely, Ali Akbari, Tawangari Toubi, Hello, Dear Mrs. Dear Mrs., In the movie about Love, a Father and his Wife love each Other very much and they are making a movie That is, very effective, and influential, in the sense that the role and the family of the children should have an effective and positive influence on their child through The school, Literature, parenting, and even The school itself will be effective in the direction of the development Of the child and in the next steps, after seeing The Last airbender, they will be making a serious movie, and in this case the child Will be made to understand the special features and the effects of their Behavior.

        <p>Generalized anxiety disorder means that a person feels anxious in a particular situation or in a general way. For example, he is worried about his wife's health and asks her to go to the doctor with him. Generalized anxiety is not specific to one or more situations. Sometimes it is seen that a child or teenager suffers from generalized anxiety disorder, which means that he is anxious in all situations of the house, school, workplace, etc. It is not a disease, and if it is a generalized anxiety, the person gets used to it and becomes anxious in different situations. For more information, you can read the book "Generalized Anxiety Disorder" by Dr. Ali Sahibi in Tehran, Tubi's Wealth House, Hello, and Good Time, published by Farzaneh Vadoudi Khana Tawangari.

        <p>With regards and respect, thank you for considering us as your confidant. In relation to what you mentioned, there are several important points that your service is provided. The first point is that psychology has many topics in common with business, but the degree of success in business is not as high as psychology. Because many topics that are similar to business are also studied in business schools, but because of the different size of business, these subjects are not studied at the same level and because of their importance, they are not taught at the level of psychology. But if you want to study psychology, it is definitely the right thing to do. Because every human being is different from another. This Gunnit philosophy has caused a lot of differences between people and each other in the field of psychology, and it is natural that even though we all believe in the same thing, our different thoughts may have different results. For example, a person who believes in psychology may be a successful person, but if he does not have many followers, he is not successful. Because he has few followers, his success is measured by the number of followers. This is the reason for the difference in thinking between people. In general, the more similar the thoughts are in the general psychology, the easier it is for them to understand each other, because the basic premise of psychology is based on following three basic principles: 1- Everything must be measurable, so that people can be measured and can be compared: 2- Nothing can be gained without a comparison. 3- Nothing more than the truth is measured, so if you believe in yourself and others and they are successful, it can be said that you have succeeded. I started with the idea that you should study psychology to get a good understanding of yourself and the field. The next point is about the place of study and. It is a good idea to study in university, but sometimes it is not the best way to study due to the conditions of the university and the pressure of work. I recommend you to study wherever you want, and you can even take the test several times from your daily schedule</p>

        <p>Because we are social beings who, when we have a moment of silence, choose a photo to show off our social relationships with others. In this way, the more our friends, the greater our intimacy and closeness to……that person. It is the same in the workplace, with the boss, everyone has a photo of the work colleague, and in the end, the boss takes the photo and the whole group photos with him. It keeps the focus narrow and does not allow us to move closer to the person we are with, or to show other people in the same situation. This way, if we know that my close friend is interested in our colleague, we show him the photo, and he gets excited, and the group photos are taken. We do not take any special action in these photos, it is just a group of friends taking a quick picture of a person. There is no action taken by the people around. It becomes a background for the group, and because we are interested in the other person, taking a photo becomes our business, and as a group, we take many pictures. The important thing is that the focus should be on the person who is important to us. If you take a close look at your friend, you may notice a behavior pattern that has been repeated many times: for example, when you take the photo of your colleague, you focus on him, and when he takes a close picture of you, you raise your photo again. The group, after taking several pictures, rotate the picture 90 degrees to the left and right. You can see the same person several times and many times again. You must be able to see your friend from several angles. This orientation is called empathy, or the inability to see another person, for example. You cannot do this with other people, only your friend can do this. rotate the phone and take a series, for instance take a picture of the group and take another one of the people from the front and the back, and after taking another picture of them from the same angle.

        <p>First, the mother should make sure that the child has no history of sexual abuse. At the same time, the father should also be sure that this child has not been abused by anyone and is not suffering from any special disorder. Children who have been abused sometimes have very vague memories, for example, they may remember something that happened a few months ago and not remember anything from the previous year. If the child remembers the incident, the therapist should try to find the background of the memory and examine the child. If it is not possible to do this, we should recognize the child and talk to him about this issue. Of course, in some cases, we may not be able to recognize the sexual abuse of the child, and in these cases we need to refer to a child and adolescent psychiatrist to help with the identification of the victim.</p>

        <p>restlessness and anxiety are relatively common in children, especially from the age of 3. This situation is completely normal in children and there is no need for treatment. However, in this regard, the family is obliged to teach the child about anxiety through a series of experiences and learn the necessary skills. In the first step, the child should be embarrassed by showing anxiety symptoms, and then the family should gradually reduce the anxiety and make the child feel comfortable in the presence of the child. It is necessary for the child to gradually reduce its anxiety symptoms with the help of a psychologist. In this way, the parents should gradually force the child into relaxation and lying by showing the child attractive behaviors. The best way to encourage children to lie is to make the environment attractive and comfortable for them. Therefore, in the home environment, try to get all the children interested in lying and making noise so that the child feels comfortable and involved in the activity. In fact, the best way is for the parents to show the child's sense of ownership towards their child, which they should do in the same way that they are doing now with the playing and sleeping rituals. Let the child know that lying is bad and lying is dangerous for the person and the child, and gradually the child will start to lie more and more. Let him know that it is better to be feared than to be loved. This method is a good encouragement for children to start lying, and it will cause them to be more comfortable in lying.</p>

It is also seen that the parents give much importance to the child and his future, so that in a successful way, the parents prevent many mistakes and have the necessary knowledge to guide him in the right way. It should be noted that proper social communication with the child is one of the skills that will help him to a successful and stable life. It seems that the child has a great need for parents, but the parents themselves do not have enough skills to guide and make him aware of the proper way of dealing with a child, so it is recommended that parents familiarize themselves with the methods of parenting with their children in order to be able to guide them in the best way.</p>
