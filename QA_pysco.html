This man was being unfairly accused in a police department scandal, and I felt sorry for him. Because I wasn’t sure that he received my letter, I sent a Facebook message to his son to pass the information on to his father, this time attaching a poem about him and the trial. Unfortunately, he received both messages. He then called my brother (who knew him well), asking why I had written twice (as though he and I don’t know each other well). Although he thought the letters were nice, he was concerned that I was perhaps stalking him in some manner.
I am so embarrassed and can’t stop thinking about the additional pain I may have caused him with the heartfelt but possibly inappropriate poem. He is suffering enough and getting much mail about a very public trial. I don’t dare write him again. My brother explained that I was well-intentioned. But I am still haunted and embarrassed about my mistake. How can I stop this ruminating over something that can’t be re-done?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>You are right to point out that some things simply can’t be redone. But you can keep from doing other damage. You can also do yourself a real favor by not overly catastrophizing the nature of what you have already done, thus heaping undue emotional grief and punishment upon yourself.
With respect to stopping ruminating, some concrete steps — advocated by cognitive-behavioral therapists — are known to really help. First, take notice of your obsessive thinking at the very earliest stages that such thinking begins. Then, re-direct your thoughts to almost anything else (something more positive in character really helps). Reinforce yourself for redirecting your thoughts and for changing them from negative to positive ones. Be prepared for the fact that the urge to return to negative, ruminative thinking will return. But you can always repeat the same procedure. With time and “rehearsal” of the technique, such rumination should decrease significantly.
It’s in the nature of conscientious people to be too hard on themselves sometimes when they make mistakes. Try to afford yourself the same degree of empathy you’re trying to display for your old acquaintance and his problems.</p>

You can also learn how to interrupt the vicious ‘cycle’ of negative thinking that already seems to be going on in your head. First of all, you must recognize that it’s not your fault that you are getting so much mail. It is most likely the other way around. Second, rethinking your letter gives the person a sense of control. You don‘teach yourself’ how to stop worrying about negative thoughts and re-direction your thoughts. Third, notice that the problem isn’te of you but of them</p>

I won’t go into details about it too much. My concern is part of my symptoms: if I “think” too much, too in-depth, I can make myself get anxiety, and I feel as though I am losing touch with what’s real..like I’m going to go insane or something. I fight it all the time. It’s best described by saying that I feel like I’m disconnecting… Is this part of anxiety?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>In mental health issues, we always examine several aspects of thinking. Two of the basic issues are thought speed and thought content. When we are free of emotional difficulties, our brain should think at a normal speed — let’s use 55 mile per hour (mph) as an example. At normal thought speed, we can pay attention to our surroundings, think logically about things, and solve problems at a good pace. If thought speed is too slow (25 mph) we can’t react quickly to our environment, think too slowly to problem solve, and can’t pull memories to help us in situations. This typically happens when we are sedated with medications.
When thought speed is too high (75 mph) our brain is running too fast to play close attention to our environment, we miss details, and we become distractible. Increased thinking speed is common in several psychiatric conditions including ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, Depression, Anxiety, etc.
Thought content is another matter. Imagine plugging your brain to a computer monitor and watching your thoughts on the screen as you think. Is there a theme to your thoughts — all depressive content? All fret and worry? No theme at all? Wild ideas about getting rich? The content tells us which disorder is most likely, as in:

Using thought content we can identify the condition, while using thought speed tells us the severity of the problem. In your case, it’s clear that your depression has returned, with some anxiety, and the “thinking too much” tells us that a return to an antidepressant medication is your best treatment option. Medications are designed to slow the thinking process, allowing more reasoning when it comes to content. When depressed, for example, your brain is full of thoughts that won’t stop, keeping you awake at night. Antidepressant medications improve those symptoms.
In the future, keep in mind that any time your brain/mind races for a prolonged period of time, it’s a sign your brain chemistry has changed to some degree. You’re not going insane…just returning to the depression as you suspected. I’d recommend consulting with a psychiatrist and returning to treatment. Keep in mind that your brain will also be returning to those old thoughts in an effort to torment you. Additional information on this type of depression can be found on this website or on my website at www.drjoecarver.com.</p>

        <p>In mental health issues, we always examine several aspects of thinking. Two of the basic issues are thought speed and thought content. When we are free of emotional difficulties, our brain should think at a normal speed — let’ve go of things as fast as we can, and we should try to keep our thoughts down. At normal thought speed, we can pay attention to our surroundings, think logically about things, and solve problems at a good pace. If thought speed is too slow (25 mph) we can’TALK!!
If thought speed Is too high (75 mph) our brain is running too fast to play close attention to something we’re excited about, something we are not paying attention to, or we are too excited about to pay attention. This typically happens when we are sedated with medications.
When thought speed runs too fast (75% mph) it tells us we are running too slowly to play our mental games, something that we should bepairing with homework or some other distraction. In this situation, it tells me I‘m losing touch’ and that I� m going insane. This is a common experience when we have a lot of responsibility for our mental health.
If your thought content is too high — you are going insane…but it’ll only get worse. Insane thoughts can be given a bad name. It tells us that we‘think too Mubarak fast’ or too sedated for our own good. It suggests a sense of internal excitement that we are unable to slow down, something typically found in individuals who have ADHD or who are very intellectualized.
I would recommend consultingBoneThrowing University for information on this type of study. They have several articles on their website about this typeofstudy. I�
d also read the information on ADHD on this website. This type of Study is typically done by a team of clinicians</p>

Chemistry, or whatever, just took me over, and no matter if I was in Miami , Atlanta or New York, I couldn’t shake thinking of him. The whole time I wondered how he was and what he has done with his life. I came 2200 miles to Illinois from Phoenix Arizona to meet with him. I discovered that he was not the man I believed him to be. I found him, still in his tiny town of 1200, with 9 felonies, and a well loathed reputation as a con artist! He told me his mother and family knew I was coming. When I arrived, fresh off the plane with my cat and belongings, they knew nothing about me!
Now, I am pregnant, and I had to take two tests in an effort to convince him that I was indeed pregnant. One test was taken with him sitting right next to me. He accused me of tampering with it! Then I took a blood test to prove to him that I was really pregnant, he said I made up the whole story on the internet! Denial at every turn! Why can’t he accept that I am pregnant with his baby and take responsibility? What’s going on?? I am taking one of his family members with me to a doctor’s appointment. Then who knows what will come of it? Very weird!</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p> This situation sounds frustrating, stressful, and disappointing. You mention that you are pregnant, and I am assuming that this pregnancy is the result of intercourse with this “con artist”. Since you describe him as a “loathsome con artist,” I believe that he will behave as a con artist would behave in most cases around this situation: he will shake off responsibility and take flight. Con artists seem to have one common trait with each other, and that is they only do things that will serve themselves; if you are served in the process too, that’s fine, but don’t expect anything else. This guy seems like a self-centered person, and the 9 felonies (since you didn’t mention what the felonies are) give enough reason for you to think twice — no, three times — about staying anywhere near this person. If you have a fantasy of this guy waking up tomorrow and telling you he wants to work a 9-5 job, live in house with a white picket fence, and be a responsible guy…that probably isn’t part of his agenda, although I could be wrong. What I suggest you do is to keep it always at the front of your mind that this man is what he is, and try not to expect anything other than what he is able to deliver. You may have to see the inside of a courthouse in order to receive child support, but maybe he will “man up” and do the right thing. Maybe. I wish you the best of luck.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p> This situation sounds frustrating, stressful, and disappointing. You mention that you are pregnant, so I am wondering if this pregnancy is going to be a real possibility for you, or if you will be able to conceive a child at this point. You mentioned that you have a family member with you to take care of the baby. I am truly interested in your situation, and wondering if you could provide a more objective opinion about this.
You mentioned that this “con artist” is in New York City, which I believe is a separate city from Phoenix, AZ. I also mentioned that for the past 22 years you have had a romantic relationship with.......... this man. I wonder if you have ever been to a New Year’S Eve party, or been to one of the consignment events at a Phoenix convention? If so, which con artist was it that you saw? What was your relationship like? How was it formed, and how long did it take you to discover this guy?

This is very interesting. I would love to</p>

Last spring I went to a psychotherapy clinic for counseling. My counselor was extraordinarily beautiful. While in session, I experienced ‘transference’ feelings and told her that I was falling in love with her. She quit my therapy suddenly. 
I miss her a lot and think about her often. She will not take my calls. I feel very guilty about this, and I started therapy because of guilt feelings. I feel so disturbed.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Therapy is a very intimate experience. Where else do you get to have someone who pays attention to you so intently and is completely on your side? It can be a wonderful feeling, especially when you’re hurting (as people generally are when they seek counseling). That is why so many people believe that they’re falling in love with their therapist. It is easy to mistake the great feeling of being heard for true emotional intimacy.
Therapy only works when the therapist is truly objective. This means that she or he cannot be your friend, lover or family member. We have to be able not only to see the overall picture (which you cannot do if you’re too closely involved) but also to tell patients things they may not want to hear. People in close relationships often hold back the hard truths due to the fear of hurting that person or ending the relationship. Therapy is a different ballgame because people go into it knowing what to expect. That is one reason why we have such strict ethical guidelines. We have to be objective in order to do our jobs!
Being objective isn’t the only challenging aspect of our jobs. We also have to deal with feelings that can be tricky. For example, when patients are experiencing transference — which is the redirection of emotions from a past relationship onto another person — it is often quite uncomfortable for the therapist. Whether you were experiencing transference or were just attracted to your therapist, the result was a situation that became extremely uncomfortable for her. This type of situation is difficult for an experienced therapist to manage and can totally freak out an inexperienced one. As many people working in clinics are novice counselors (and often are young), I’m guessing that this may have been the first time she encountered a patient falling in love with her; that she probably didn’t know what to do and, instead of going to a supervisor, working through it and then talking with you, she abruptly terminated therapy. 
That this occurred is very unfortunate but it isn’t something you should feel guilty about. Whenever something unpleasant that I cannot undo happens to me, I try to look upon it as a learning experience. One possible lesson for you in this instance could be that, if therapy is going to be effective, you may prefer to have a male therapist next time.</p>

It can be a wonderful feeling, especially when you’re hurting (as people generally are when they seek counseling).

Therapy is a different ballgame because people go into it knowing what to expect. That is one reason why we have such strict ethical guidelines. We also have to take into consideration the feelings that come along with being a member of a therapeutic program. That means that we have to have a safety plan in place if something goes wrong. That being said, most people have a personal safety plan that they use when they are experiencing transference.
That being said however, a good therapist will not be able to assess your feelings so intentially. That may change if you are experiencing intense transference symptoms. If that’ses true, then finding a therapist who is objective will be difficult. It will be like going to a New Year’S Eve party with the intention of having a ‘special occasion’. As I always tell people, a “special occasion' is a special occasion. You will have to make sure that you have a plan and event for the event. If it is a really hard event for you, then don’t go to New YearS Eve. You can take some steps in the meantime to make yourself feel better.</p>

My husband only explodes at people who are closest to him. At work, everyone loves him and all of my friends think he is amazing. But at home, it is different. He is not physically abusive in any way, although I’m told he fought a lot with kids as a teenager. Still, he is verbally aggressive and has no problem demeaning me. He always tells me about how he does everything for the family and I do nothing. (I am a registered nurse but a stay at home mom for the most part because we have children who are 3 1/2 and 5.) He will bring up issues from the past and go on and on about them, even if they are resolved currently. He recently yelled and screamed at my parents, which has happened before. He seems to show no respect for them or his own parents. He shows a ton of love to the kids, but he can’t control himself when yelling at other people in front of them. It almost seems like he goes into some other world, and nobody can stop him from getting angrier and trying to make his point. He thinks that he doesn’t have a problem, and that his close family members are the ones that who the issues. Ironically, he is a professor of communications at a university.
Is the problem one of anger management? How do I even attempt to get him help?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>There could be several underlying reasons for the kind of behavior your husband is displaying. Some folks have much pent-up anger and a lack of coping skill when it comes to managing and expressing anger appropriately. Others might be laboring under a mood disturbance that either exacerbates anger or prompts its unregulated expression. Still others suffer from an inhibitory deficit that causes them to “explode” with anger in an out of character way and over incidents that don’t rationally appear to warrant that degree of upset.
Regardless of the possible underlying reasons, however, it’s fairly clear from what you say (e.g., your husband making berating, demeaning statements, brandishing undue anger in front of the children, etc.) that your husband has a problem. That being said, it’s important for you to recognize that the problem is his. And if you spend too much time trying to understand the reasons for it or attempting to seek help about it, you might inadvertently only enable it.

Your responsibility is to set and enforce reasonable limits with respect to the kinds of behavior you, your children, and your family experience. It’s your husband’s responsibility to manage himself appropriately and to seek appropriate help if he hasn’t yet acquired the skills to do so.
My best suggestion: stand up for civil conduct in your home and insist your husband seek a professional evaluation and secure the help he needs.</p>

While we were on vacation at the beach and my sister and cousins started to drown, my father went in after them and never came back out. No one knows for sure what happened since he was an excellent swimmer, and it was a shock to the entire family and community when he died. It took me a long time to finally accept it and incorporate it into my life. Recently however, I’ve been getting the feeling that I or my mother will die soon. I keep dreaming about it and just have this sense, every time I go out. I think such things as: “This is the day I’ll crash my car and never make it home.” Is this normal? Are all these things a normal part of the grieving process?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Some mental health experts distinguish between relatively “normal” or “uncomplicated” grief and more “complicated” or “traumatic” bereavement. Sometimes, no counseling at all is necessary to work through relatively uncomplicated grief, although some individuals find grief counseling (as opposed to more specialized grief “therapy”) to be helpful even in relatively uncomplicated situations. But other times, especially when death is sudden, occurs at critical developmental stages, or is accompanied by disaster or other forms of trauma, sorting through the wide range of accompanying feelings can be a relatively complicated matter that often warrants highly specialized professional attention. Some survivors of trauma experience unconscious feelings of guilt, sadness, and rage that cannot be expressed directly without causing additional emotional pain and therefore express themselves in a myriad of other psychological symptoms. It might be best to seek the counsel of an experienced grief therapist to help determine your individual needs and the best course of resolution.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>In your family, you and your mother have always had a certain level of bereavement. The death of your father probably forced your mother to operate in “survival mode” during your vacation. As a result, you are now emotionally exhausted and overwhelmed. In your family situation, you will be experiencing the normal symptoms of depression — exhaustion, loss of humor, crying spells, sleep problems, etc. While your sister and friends may be experiencing sleep problems (also common in a bereavement situation), you will experience rapid mind speed, poor concentration, fatigue, irritability, and low energy.
Your mother has probably been overwhelmed by the loss of your Dad. The fact that she is now overwhelmed by his loss makes it even more likely that her mental and emotional health is not working as well as she should. For this reason, she will be dealing with the bereavement symptoms for many months.
I would recommend:
Your sister and her friends are experiencing a significant loss. It would be extremely important that all family memberships address the issues and concerns they have…and this includes your mother.</p>

He tells me every day how lucky he is to be with me and that I am his best friend.
I’d never had any doubts or trust issues with him until I got a text from a girl to whom he “accidentally” sent a risqué picture of himself. That’s what he said when I asked him about it. I told myself, “he loves you; he’s telling the truth.” I couldn’t stop thinking about it though, so I looked at his phone.

How can I get him to come clean with me? How do I know there haven’t been other girls? Does he mean it when he tells me he wants to marry me, and if he does, why would he do something like this?

        <p>Trust is one of the main foundations of a healthy relationship yet it is one of the hardest to achieve because it needs to be earned instead of freely given. It sounds like it is a huge problem for you and your boyfriend. You didn’t mention whether his messing around with this girl occurred prior to your relationship, or whether the risqué picture was sent during the course of your relationship or before. If both occurred before the two of you started dating, I’d encourage you to let the past stay there. If he did either of these things while he was dating you, then a major discussion is in order. 
Although very few people send risqué pictures of themselves by accident, it is the sexual interaction and lying that are the most troublesome. If there is to be any trust in this relationship, I recommend confessing to him that you looked at his phone and asking point blank whether he cheated on you. If it turns out that he did not, apologize for your mistrust and explain to him how your past experiences colored your present thoughts and actions. Then you need to figure out how you can deal with your anxiety over infidelity. 

However, if it turns out he was indeed unfaithful to you then you have some decisions to make. There are many reasons why people cheat. Sometimes they actually do love and want to be with their current partner but they just don’t know how to be faithful. More and more we’re hearing about sexual addiction (a process addiction that is similar in dynamics to a substance addiction) and it could be that your boyfriend suffers from this. 
Whatever the reason for his infidelity, if he is honest with you about what happened and is willing to work on changing his ways, it may be worth staying if you want to give him the chance. In this situation, I strongly recommend that both of you seek counseling individually and as a couple. If however he continues to lie to you, it is doubtful that he is going to do anything different (although he might not use his phone for his cheating) and staying with him may be more heartache than it is worth.
Regardless of whether you decide to leave or stay in the relationship, I encourage you to seek counseling by yourself. It sounds like you have a track record with cheaters and this relational pattern may be one that is worth examining.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>It sounds like you have good reason to be concerned about this situation. Since he has not allegedly changed and is not currently in the throes of a true romance, there is ample evidence that his behavior is the result of some unmet need or unhealthiness. If there is any truth in what he says, it certainly won”t be hidden. And, if there is anything that you need to tell him so that he can respect your right to remain a friend, then do so without delay.
My best suggestion: insist this man gets the help necessary to make awards for his behavior and to demonstrate that he‘can’T’ trust’ or respect boundaries. If he cannot respect boundaries, then there is every reason to hope that he will change and respect boundaries once he has.</p>

About a year ago, I started becoming aware that I have difficulty remembering things that people tell me. I am married now, and because of this problem my wife gets really angry with me at times. 
I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I get enough sleep. I do have some money stress, but so does she, and she remembers the kinds of things I forget with no problem. I eat right. I don’t drink or do drugs. Can you tell me what’s going on?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>A. Many clinicians refer to the kind of problems you report as “forgetfulness.” And forgetfulness can result from a variety of issues; the leading causes include:
You report leading a relatively healthy lifestyle, getting enough rest, etc., and you might be able to rule out many of the above outlined causes. It’s quite possible that the reason you can’t recall some of the things you wish is because they don’t get placed into memory in the first place. This is often associated with a lack of focus or concentration when the information is imparted. If our mind is busy with other things or there is a lot of “background clutter,” we sometimes only half-hear and poorly encode information others are trying to impart to us.
If you’re really concerned about this issue, it would probably be a good idea to visit with a mental health professional. Because there are so many possible explanations for what you’re experiencing, and because there are many ways you might get the help necessary to overcome the issues, it would likely benefit you greatly to have the situation evaluated.</p>

We met and about 2 months later I accidentally got pregnant. Then we decided to get married when I was about 4 months pregnant. So in total we’ve known each other for about 1 1/2 years. First mistake. Things were pretty smooth up until about 3 months ago. He has always had a bad temper at times but now he’s become more and more angry and is doing things that are just down right irresponsible and immature. I am 35, he is 28…and I am just sick and tired of his miserable attitude. He rarely smiles, and everything that goes wrong in his day is taken out on me. He’s cold, and if he says he’s sorry it only lasts a couple days and he’s back to being mean and gives me the silent treatment. I have put my foot down and have told him to stop drinking beer every day — because that doesn’t help — and to genuinely change his behavior or I am calling it quits. Of course this only makes him more angry because I’m defending myself. He is a very good father. Our son is 7 months old. We started seeing a marriage counselor last week but sometimes I feel so hurt and torn up inside from all the ways he’s hurt me and lied to me that I sometimes wonder if I will ever believe in him again and want to continue the marriage. Should I just keep my mouth shut and bear it while we go to a few more sessions with the marriage counselor or should I just ask him to leave for now and hope that he will continue to go to the sessions? Thank You.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Some of the key parts to your story are:
There are issues here that are in the long-term category such as his drinking, his temper issues, and the combination of relationship, marriage, and child all within the past 18 months. There are also issues that are fairly recent, surfacing in the past three months, such as increased drinking, increased temper, and increased problems in communication.
I suspect that both of you are experiencing a lot of stress at this time. You didn’t have a lot of time to form your relationship before the stress level increased dramatically with the arrival of your son. Stress can be viewed as bad pressures but it’s also the level of responsibility we have — the number of obligations — the pressure of time, etc. Both of you went from easy-living singles to a new marriage and new parenthood in a period of 12 months. There is a lot of stress here. Stress amplifies our normal personality so if he was always a drinker and hot-head, that will increase. His immaturity as a new father will also be showing at this time. On the positive side, he exhibits a good interest in his son and is willing to participate in marriage counseling.

My sense tells me that you need to give the situation more time. Wait to see if the marital counseling will be helpful. Both of you need to do some self-checks for depression as this is a common side effect of stress. You both may also be inexperienced regarding marital communication — especially if this is a first marriage for both of you.
The issue here is not keeping your mouth shut, but rather trying to solve problems rather than only pointing them out. Your new husband may truly not know what to do to improve the situation. Getting married and having a child does not make us instant competent, knowledgeable, and highly-skilled partners and parents. Giving a teenager an autobmobile doesn’t make them a skilled driver — classes and experience are needed. You both may need some classes (marital counseling) and some marital problem-solving experience. Being a very good father, as you describe, suggests some positive possibilities in the future if you can get over this speed bump in your marriage.</p>

I don’t do anything really bad or hurtful to people, but I am just too distant and cold. I don’t call people who are supposed to be my friends, I don’t miss anyone.

        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>A:It sounds like you give your husband due consideration and you care about this issue enough to write about it. It sounds like you are open to personal feedback, even if it takes you a little while to process it. Because this is a social problem, then it might best be addressed in a group setting. Have you considered looking for a therapy group that is running long-term in your area? Check your local resources and see if there is something called a ‘process group’. If you find one with compatible members (preferably five to nine members) and leader, then make a promise to yourself to stay in it for at least one year. You may discover that there are things you care about. You may find that you are depressed and your feelings have been flattened, but they’re there. You may get feedback from others that you think is dead wrong about yourself. In that case you might ask, “what is it about me that gave them such a false impression?” Even incorrect feedback from others can be a learning experience.
In psychology there is a disorder known as the ‘anti-disorder’. I say this because a disorder, by definition, causes some distress. However, in schizoid personality disorder there is no distress. The person is isolated, turned away from social interactions, a loner, and is not bothered by it. In that case he may just live a quiet, reserved life without complaint, only feeling anxious when it’s time to get to an appointment and afraid of being late. This, however, does not seem to describe you. You say “I don’t want to be this bad emotionless person”. Someone with a schizoid personality would not make a statement like that. More likely, something else is going on for you. In a therapy group you will not be on the hot seat to talk at every opportunity. You can listen to others and add as you feel like it. Once you feel safe and comfortable with the group, you may be surprised at what develops.</p>

Since then, this incident has not cleared out of his mind and he gets sexually aggravated very often to the point that he resorts to watching porn a lot and ends up doing other things.
It seems that when he tries not to, he goes through bad dreams full of the incident, and it happens in bed. He seems to be going through a very tough state and finds it hard to be happy or to concentrate on life, although he studies in a very nice engineering college. His dream was to join the military, which he couldn’t as his eyes are weak. 
I tried to help him out, but now he seems to have fallen in love with me. I don’t love him, but I want him to be cured of this problem. How can I help?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>It’s a sign of a good person that you want to help him out. However, I believe from your sentence structure and phrasing (corrected for publication) that you may be under age. When talking with people over the Internet — in any form such as email, text messaging, etc. — we must constantly protect ourselves. From your description, he has moved your conversation into sexual areas including descriptions of his sexual interests and behavior — now suggesting that he has fallen in love with you. I think you have appropriately understood that you don’t love him but still want to help him. 
In your situation, there are two separate problems. First is providing help to him. Some ways you can do that:
The second problem is protecting yourself. Some ways to do that:
I can tell that you’re a good person and would like to help people, including this man. I sense this relationship is moving into a dangerous area. If he truly has mental health issues, professionals are available to provide help — and he knows that…</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>It’s a sign of a good person that you want to help this friend out. However WAIT! Your friend needs to be educated about the symptoms of sexual assault — what we call them. An assault is a sexual assault that is severe enough to qualify as a “love affair”. An affair is when there are multiple partners involved, often with military or other groups.  (The condition for the affair in question is an Affair Affair. It’Sextures three partners, each with their own specific symptoms. When we experience an affair, it’sssssss like we’re having a ‘best of both worlds’ situation. We have the freedom to be with friends who have a safe, romantic relationship with no risk of physical abuse. When you watch pornography, you’ll also experience the full-blown romance/sexual assault experience.  When you help him, you are helping him to become educated about his “problem” and to deal with the aftermath of the attack. He doesn’T have a free pass to join any military or police department. He has to deal damage to his brain and emotionally.  You can’ticize that experience by asking him if he’d like to join a psychotherapy group.

I find it interesting that you mention the presence of theAffair. I’m assuming that your friend is sexually aggravated and that the sexual assault has cured that problem. If that is indeed the case, then counseling of some sort is in order. However, the situation you describe is not uncommon for</p>

Also I am having liver problems, which I’m seeing a specialist about, and am going through tests right now.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Your physician is correct with her selection of an antidepressant — for several reasons. In menopause, the brain has problems with the production of Serotonin, a neurotransmitter that controls and regulates body temperature, appetite, sleep, energy level, etc. The use of various hormones for treatment indirectly influences the levels of Serotonin. In the current treatment of these symptoms, it is recommended to use an antidepressant that directly influences the levels of Serotonin in the brain — thus controlling not only the physical symptoms, but the emotional aspects of menopause — some of which are depression symptoms. While stabilizing Serotonin levels, the medication also stabilizes mood control, reduces irritability, improves sleep, etc.
I’ve written an article that might be helpful entitled The Chemical Imbalance. It’s available on my website at www.drjoecarver.com. It might be able to explain the various neurotransmitters involved in depression, menopause, and anxiety.
If you are also evaluating your liver functioning, be sure to mention your medication to the liver specialist, as some antidepressants influence liver functioning.
While you’re not happy taking an antidepressant, it’s very likely that you’re not happy with a lot of things at this time. That’s the emotional side of menopausse. I think you’ll be surprised how well the medication works. Keep in mind that she will need to find an antidepressant that is a good fit for your metobalism. Thirty-five percent of people switch medications, so don’t be disheartened if you need to use a different one if the Citalopram doesn’t work well or fast enough.
Hope this reply is helpful.</p>

My boyfriend and I have been together for three years now, and I have known his family for over 11 years. His mother even thought of me as her “adopted” daughter. When I was 18 and was visiting at her house, her then 23-year-old son was attracted to me and mentioned it to his younger sister who was about 16 at the time. She gave him my number and suggested we go out, so we did.
When we started dating, my boyfriend’s mother and sister were SO happy and constantly told us so. But once we started getting really serious and started spending less time at the house, things changed. His younger sister was upset he wasn’t spending as much time with her as before we started dating, she said something to her mom, and that’s where his mother got involved big time. This same thing happened with his last serious girlfriend. The only difference is that I am considered family, whereas she wasn’t.
No one has hurt me the way she has, and that’s why it’s so upsetting to me. I have tried to resolve things with her, even suggesting that she and I just start over, but things just get thrown back in my face each time. After her calling me many names, and saying mean and horrible things, we are at the point now where I just don’t feel welcome at her gatherings, nor do I really want to be there.
I don’t blame her for all of this; it is all of our faults, and I will be the first to admit it. But looking back, I really haven’t done anything to her except fall in love with her son and start a life with him. It’s tearing my boyfriend and me apart, and I just don’t know what to do.

        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>You should bear in mind that one fact is inevitably true: change is hard. And whether you fully realized or intended it, when you started getting serious with your boyfriend, you made a much bigger impact on the family “system” than you did when you became an “adopted” member and friend.
Psychologists and other therapists who subscribe to “systems theory” will tell you that all systems, including family systems, try to maintain homeostasis. That’s because in a system, all parties derive something out of their respective roles and relationships within the system. That’s what keeps the system going. And the system can become really stressed and upset when change is thrust upon it.

Just because things have been a certain way and everyone kind of likes it the way things have been doesn’t mean things can’t change. Change is what growth and life are all about. But change usually involves costs, especially to an established system, and that makes change difficult. 
Seeing a counselor or therapist, especially one with a systems orientation, is probably a good idea. But in the end, what will probably make the biggest difference is acknowledging the pain each member of the system is going through because of the changes afoot. In time, your empathy and understanding might become appreciated to the point that you’re embraced as much more than just an “adopted” member of the family. If that doesn’t happen, however, you might want to re-evaluate how much dysfunction there may be in the family. And remember, in a dysfunctional system, everyone plays a role.</p>

My father was abusive and violent; my mother is vulnerable, with low self-esteem. I have always been criticized and insulted by both. I grew up with a sense of low self-esteem, insecurity and diffidence, although I’m pretty and have always been superior in study and work life.
Now I’m married to a man who most likely has alexithymia. He has never been intimate or expressed any sort of passion; I doubt if he even knows how to be intimate. This marriage has resulted in two kids — a girl and a boy. My daughter is five years old and has autistic features.
Over our seven years of marriage, I have suffered from emotional and sexual deprivation, loss of communication, and disrespect. But there is plenty of emotion and passion inside me. I have tried to compensate by being close and intimate with my children and friends, but believe me, nothing compensates for a spouse.
I long for a real relationship, and I need to feel intimate with a good man who loves and respects me, but how? I have tried in vain to fulfill my needs with my husband, but we always end up with fighting. I never feel happy with him anytime, anywhere.
I know that divorce will be destructive to my kids, especially my daughter.
How can I cope with this failure in relationship, and if possible, how can I stop my desperate need for sex and intimacy?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Given your history with your parents, it is likely that you entered adulthood with a fear of strong expressed emotions and emotional intimacy. As a result, you chose as a partner a man whose lack of emotional expression must have felt much safer than the emotional and physical abuse you grew up with. However, it sounds like you have reached a point in your life where you are more comfortable with, and in fact are craving, more intimacy, and are distressed that your husband is not changing to meet your needs.
Many marriages can be threatened when partners’ emotional needs and personal maturation pull them out of sync with each other. You had clear reasons for being averse to intimacy when you were younger, and it may be that your husband has his own story behind his lack of expressed emotions. It may also be that, like your daughter, he has more organic causes for not desiring intimacy with you. However, beyond arguing with him, it is unclear to me whether you have pursued other means to improve your relationship and save your marriage.

As you are concerned about the destructive effect of divorce on your kids, it is my opinion that your best option is to begin couples therapy with your husband. With the help of a licensed therapist who has experience working with couples, you can discuss your “desperate need” for sex, intimacy, and respect. These are very natural needs and your counselor can help you both clarify what your expectations are, and whether you can find a way to meet each other’s needs in a way that will allow you to preserve your marriage.
If after meeting with your therapist you both feel unable to find a middle ground, you may decide to begin strategizing how best to protect your children from the impact of a divorce. There are many books available with information to help you, for example, Making Divorce Easier on Your Child: 50 Effective Ways to Help Children Adjust, by Nicholas Long and Rex L Forehand . Additionally, you could ask your daughter’s doctor for a referral to a licensed social worker or therapist who works with autistic children, whom you can consult with.
Finally, regardless of the fate of your marriage, I encourage you to see an individual therapist. Whether with your husband, children, friends, or a future love, the quality of your future relationships will depend on your ability to work through your own history of disordered emotional attachments.</p>

Am I “mad” to have become frantic when I realized that there was a bag with clothes and a gun in it found in the park right behind the business where we worked? I cringed with disgust at their words and then slugged one when I had heard enough, because it built too much pressure in me. I have had no luck with local support in this, and was told by the businesses owner that he thinks I am mentally unstable. I am now looking for other work because of it all. About a week after the incident someone was chased by Police behind the building, but they weren’t caught. To me it seems all too coincidental.</p>

        <p>These events you describe are not coincidental — a seemingly planned sequence of accidentally occurring events (Webster’s Dictionary): they are totally unrelated. What you are describing is paranoia that may have been building over several months. The paranoia may be caused by job-related stress or other factors. Here’s how it works:
I would recommend consulting a psychiatrist. A high level of stress can produce paranoid thoughts and behavior. Paranoia can also surface when we use or change medications for medical conditions. It can also be a sign of depression or anxiety. A psychiatrist is best trained to separate the medical, medication, and brain chemistry issues known to be associated with paranoia.</p>

For a while now I have noticed that she sometimes stares blankly. At first, I thought she did it because she was daydreaming, or listening and taking it all in. There is never a loss of consciousness and she picks up where she left off, although last time I was with her and saw her staring blankly I waved my hand over her face and received no response.
Now I am frightened because I have just been told more to this story. Without any seeming reason, she clenches her fists to her face and shakes. Once while this was happening she said, “I’m not angry…” After these fits, she seems to breathe better.
My biggest problem is her parents’ denial that she needs to be seen by a neurologist or an epileptologist. My father suffered grand mal epilepsy, and childhood epilepsy has nothing on that! And I know how hard it is to admit that there could be something wrong…my own child has juvenile diabetes.
How could I approach the situation? She needs help right away.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>First, good job making such clear observations. There seems to be reason for your concern. Second, one must respect a parent’s right to raise their children as they see fit. Absent an abusive situation, parents do have the right to say where and when a child will receive treatment or evaluation. That being said, there are other professionals who will also be watching her and can express their own opinions to the parents. The day care or preschool nurse, for example, can alert parents to conspicuous behaviors. If you felt so moved, you could contact the school or preschool and let them know, in confidence and as a concerned family member, that there is this one behavior that is troubling and would they please watch out for it. Without an informed consent from the parents, they will not speak to you. However, they will listen to you and make note of the conversation. That way, you have done your due diligence, can defer to them, and can then step back into the comfortable role of supportive aunt or uncle.
Although the parents deny that she has a problem, they have no doubt heard your concern. Hopefully there will not be a serious incident that will break their denial. However, they can’t help but see what you see in time. When they see it, they may remember your words and then be ready to take action. If so, then your warning will prove to be very valuable indeed.
The disorders you’re considering are beyond the scope of my expertise. It may be a petit mal seizure disorder or it may be something else. When her behavior starts to interfere with escalating expectations of performance at school and socially, then it will become more visible. I encourage you to stay present, stay available and patient, and see if the parents come to you.</p>

Although the parents deny that she has a problem and are willing to see a neurologologist or a psychologist, they cannot force the issue of treatment unless there is a clear danger to self/others presented. If there is no danger to herself or others, then parents should be able to ignore her behavior and look toward her on her own. However you also fear that they will say something to her mother and an unfair advantage for her if she</p>

My ex would fit the category of a sociopath, as he was very abusive. He was not much of a dad to our child and continues not to be. Well, sometimes he is and sometimes he is not. Now a guy I had been dating for awhile has formed a bond with our child. Sometimes I push him away because I don’t want my child to have any confusion about his dad. I’m afraid he will be confused, and at 2 years old, I can’t explain much to him. Am I doing the right thing or am I wrong?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>You are wrong to push the new guy away from your child, especially if he is a good man. Why? Your sociopathic/abusive ex will gradually fade away over the years as sociopaths are totally selfish and have no true concern for parenting. Your child will need a stable father figure, something the ex will be unable and unwilling to provide. Thousands of children receive healthy parenting from a stepfather while they know who their biological father is without question…they just rarely see him. 
Keep in mind that as your relationship with the new boyfriend grows, your sociopathic ex may try to ruin the relationship. He does that not because he loves you or the child, but because sociopaths always try to keep ex victims/partners on the “back burner” — always available just in case they need something. I’d recommend reading my article on Identifying Losers and reviewing the discussion group on this topic on this website. 
Having a sociopath for a “Dad” is not having a father, any more than having a sociopath for a relationship partner is having a good boyfriend. Both you and your child will improve your life if a good man joins your family.</p>

You can‘prove that your relationship is working and healthy by providing a steady stream of communications — mostly emails and phone calls. Keep in Mind that as time passes, your sociopath ex may try to ruin the relationship or he may return to the same abusive behavior. You need to keep your communication open and available. If he tries to ruin it, you can respond by sending a strongly worded letter to his current girlfriend.</p>

I am a 27-year-old male who was diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age. Since then I have been diagnosed with chronic depression. Some moments I am really excited and happy, and others I feel completely down in the dumps. I’m not sure if I should tack on Bipolar Disorder or OCD to my laundry list of problems.

        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Intrusive thoughts are typically associated with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). In clinical practice there is a strong link between ADHD and OCD and an even stronger link between Depression and OCD. 
The intrusive and obsessive thoughts you are experiencing are not associated with a Bipolar Disorder. Depression and OCD are related to low levels of the neurotransmitter Serotonin, and it’s very common for depressed individuals to develop obsessive thoughts. As you describe, obsessive thoughts are always very uncomfortable and typically involve repulsive, immoral, or humiliating thoughts. These obsessive thoughts usually have a content/subject that is offensive to the specific individual. In post-partum depression, good mothers report obsessive thoughts to harm their new baby. Religous individuals are tormented by obscene thoughts. People who curse like a sailor don’t receive cursing obsessive thoughts…they get something else.
In your specific situation, Depression is the problem. Your Depression is producing the obsessive thoughts and fears of humiliation (sudden urinating). When we review your medications, your antidepressant, Remeron, is a low dose and is probably being used as a sleeping pill. Treatment for OCD obsessive thoughts typically involves a medication that increases the availability of Serotonin such as a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). 

Treatment for your obsessive thoughts will involve a change in your medications. I strongly recommend that you bring these symptoms to the attention of your physician or psychiatrist. Don’t be embarrassed about the nature of the thoughts as from a clinical standpoint, those thoughts are a symptom of low Serotonin and not some strange relationship with your family members. Those are obsessive thoughts — not sexual concerns. You are not a horribly perverted person — you’re a person with commonly-encountered obsessive thoughts.

The intrusive and obsessive thoughts you are experiencing are not associated with a Bipolar diagnosis. Depression and Obsessives-Compulsivity Disorder (as well as my two children, ADHD and Asperger’s Disorder) are both considered to be related to low levels of the neurotransmitter Serotonin. The depression neurotransmitter is also linked to Obsessively-Comparing values with Tourette’SADHD. In the community, low levels are often associated with obsessive thoughts, rituals, counting, etc. In depression, it’ll be discussed in passing thoughts and rituals involving past events or traumatic events. In obsessive thoughts we are left with the uncomfortable situation of having obsessive thoughts — thoughts that are specifically selected to be intrusive.  
I would recommend consultation with a psychiatrist. The presence of obsessive thoughts will gradually increase in quality as you become more comfortable with the nature of the thoughts. I would also recommend consultation for Tourette Syndrome as that medication also has an antidepressant action.</p>

I’m probably bipolar, as that is the most common diagnosis I receive. I have made a serious suicide attempt and I have been hospitalised seperately for suicidal depression. I have gone on a wild shopping spree in which I bought useless items I thought I wanted and because it was fun, and was left with a negative checking account balance, no money for rent and an eviction notice on the door a short time later. I am a cutter, though with therapy I now go months without self-harming. When I am off my medication my normally great work ethic fails, I tend to get in trouble for not working and I know I spend more time thinking about non-work related things or playing on the computer than getting actual work done.
I am supposed to be on a cocktail of 2 antidepressants, a mood stabiliser, and a antipsychotic drug, but for the life of me I can never stay on them for long. Times like now, I feel bad — like I am disappointing my family, friends and most importantly, my therapist and psychiatrist. I hate taking medication, always have — even antibiotics. And maybe I’m lazy. I like how I feel off medication (at least at first when I’m feeling good). I have more energy and feel more creative. I never have a good reason to stop the medications and I know how dangerous it is for me to do so cold turkey, but I cannot seem to take them properly. The only times I’ve ever really been good at it is during a stay in the hospital or immediately after. 
Friends I have who suffer from anxiety or depression are always shocked that I’d take myself off my medication — they would never do that. They don’t understand why I do it any more than I do. Is it common for people to take themselves off medication? How do I force myself to take them properly when I really don’t want to? I hate how I become after a month or so without the medication and swear up and down that THIS TIME I’ll take the pills as I’m supposed to. But once I’m on them, it doesn’t seem to take long for the decision to stop sets in no matter how good my intentions.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>I’m told that medication noncompliance is about 45% — in all areas of medicine. People don’t want to take their medications as prescribed, side effects bother them, they don’t take them on the right schedule, they quit taking them early, etc. Bipolar Disorder presents special problems, such as:

When tempted to discontinue or reduce your medications, you might want to use a method often used in alcohol treatment. People with alcoholism don’t refrain from drinking by thinking of the “good times” on alcohol — they think of the “bad times”. If you think about manic episodes — a portion of that memory will be very tempting because it will contain an “Emotional Memory” or memorized feeling of that time. When we think about a joyful experience, we feel the joy…that kind of thing. When you find yourself considering no medication — remember the job losses, financial ruin, forced hospitalizations, etc. You are prescribed medications for your protection. When you are tempted to stop your medications, talk to your therapist/counselor or other supportive individual.</p>

I’ve had thoughts of a certain person poisoning the food, etc. (because I feel I perceive their true motive). On occasion, I’ve felt as Jim Carrey would on ‘The Truman Show’ — that my thoughts or experiences are being broadcast to a wide range of the population. In fact, 24/7. I also experience a mixture between delusions of reference and delusions of grandeur (kind of) — in the sense that certain media broadcasts will reflect my own life experience… It is as if they were aired solely for my perception — and that I’m some kind of divine entity having had this capability. But I am inquiring as to whether or not this can be seen as some kind of gradual development into schizophrenic domains. I’m just curious because last night, I perceived exteriorized vocalization not attached to any physical being… There was a voice coming from a certain area of the room. First of all, I’m not sure if it was simply a false awakening (that I dreamed I heard a voice while laying in my bed). Secondly, the voice was well audible — but incomprehensible. I could hear it, but I could not understand it. Since then, the voice has subsided and this has never occurred previously. Should I wait it out and see if it will happen again? I don’t want to get too involved if it was simply a false awakening, but just as a false awakening, it seemed realistic. </p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>There is a big difference between a Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD), Delusional Disorder, and Paranoid Schizophrenia. You are describing a Delusional Disorder which is more severe. Delusional Disorders not only include paranoid symptoms, but the gradual development of delusions (false beliefs and interpretations) of both persecution and grandeur. One develops the feeling that the entire environment is somehow involved in an organized effort or conspiracy for some mysterious purpose. Ideas of Reference (attaching personal significance to common experiences in the environment) are severe — feeling that people on cell phones are talking about you, receiving messages from the TV and radio, and experiencing that Jim Carrey or “Matrix” sense that the entire environment has been created for you — and only for you. This is a Delusional Disorder.

The surfacing of external vocalizations is very serious and moves more in the direction of Schizophrenia. In this condition, you will experience “voices” that are external. As you describe, they are initially mumbling or difficult to understand. As they increase in number, they also increase in clarity. These are auditory hallucinations and are soon accompanied by hallucinations involving other senses such as tactile (touch/sensation), gustatory (taste), and olfactory (smell) hallucinations. Visual hallucinations are rare but you’ll have illusions — seeing patterns/pictures in smoke, clouds, carpet patterns, etc. 
I highly recommend that you seek psychiatric consultation. Suspiciousness, paranoia, ideas of reference, delusions, and hallucinations are on a scale of increasing Dopamine in the brain. The neurotransmitter Dopamine determines our perception of personal relevancy in our environment. Too little Dopamine and we have ADHD — nothing is related to us so we don’t pay attention to anything. Average Dopamine and we can tell who we know and who we don’t know in a crowd. Too much Dopamine and suddenly everything in the environment is personally related to us. This is a highly serious psychiatric issue and will not resolve on its own. We have medications that lower and stabilize Dopamine levels. They can be of great help in your situation.</p>

We have a cordial relationship, but sometimes it gets out of hand. We had two beautiful young boys together, which is the main reason why I haven’t completely moved on. I still see my ex, and we sleep together occasionally, even though he continues to date. He has basically moved on with his life, but I haven’t.
My ex recently told me that he wants to have a baby girl. He said that he doesn’t know who he’ll try to have the child with, but he is currently looking. This has sparked many emotions with me. I worry that he won’t have as much time for our boys once he has another child, and I worry that he won’t be able to give me and the boys financial assistance. I am on his medical plan, together with the children, but that would change with a new baby and mother. So, now I’m wondering whether I should offer to bear his child. Sounds crazy, right? But at least my children wouldn’t be competing with a sibling who doesn’t stay with them. I know they would love to have a sister, but if the sister were from another mother, it would be confusing for them. My oldest always draws pictures of me and his dad getting married, and I know he really wants us to be together. What do I do?

The woman found out she was pregnant and decided to have the child, even after my fiancé was truthful with her that he had accepted a job out of state, that he was not ready to have a child, and that he did not want to be in a long term relationship with her. He is very successful financially and feels that perhaps he was taken advantage of by this woman or that maybe she got pregnant intentionally.
He has been paying child support ever since the boy was born but has not yet met his child. His reasons for not ever having direct contact with the child are mostly that he is unsure of how to get over his anger, resentment, and fear regarding the mother so that he could even begin to consider a relationship with his son. I have been supportive of him in this decision, since he is paying very high child support and not leaving the child and mother in a desperate position. But lately as we consider children of our own, and because I see this situation looming over him and causing him to be depressed often, I have begun to think he will be happier once he has a relationship with the child.
I told him how I have been thinking about the matter, and he is open to beginning a relationship and is also open to the idea that such a relationship will give him peace and allow him to let go of some of the anger he has toward the mother.
But how do I help him get over his anger? Sometimes I wonder if he should just rip off the band-aid and meet the boy and the rest will not seem so horrible. I am sure the mother would want her child to meet his father. But she has been difficult, sending hateful emails and lately using aliases to post horrible messages about him on public forums. This just makes it more difficult for my fiancé to see how this situation could end up working out.
Thank you so much for your help.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>It’s fairly impossible to assess the full nature of your situation so remotely and quite difficult to provide accurate feedback. However, there are some things you probably should consider. 
First, the last time I checked, it takes two people to conceive a child. Although your fiancé might have felt “taken advantage of,” he is responsible for his actions and their consequences.
Second, the child deserves parenting from individuals not consumed with unproductive anger, resentment, bitterness, or any of the other negative emotions and attitudes that toxic relationships are based upon. So, if your fiancé wishes to take an active role in the parenting of this child, he’ll need to work through his issues. You can certainly support him in that effort, but there’s really nothing you can do to remove his anger.

Third, there is something incongruent about your statement that the mother of this child would “certainly want” your fiancé to meet and be involved with his son yet has been sending “hateful” emails and posting “horrible” things about him on message boards. So, it appears that there is much to be worked out not only between this woman and your fiancé but also with you — because if this child becomes a bigger part of your lives, you will all have dealings with one another, and it’s important to the child that your relationships be cordial and supportive.
Remember, this is ultimately not about you, your fiancé, his anger, or this woman’s feelings. It’s about a child who didn’t do anything wrong and needs parents to love, nurture, and guide him.</p>

He has always been behind and “petite”. Recently however, I have noticed some changes that have me questioning whether my son has some “mild” Autistic traits. Being that he is 21 months old, he “scoots” on his bottom to crawl, he only stands when holding my hand for fear of falling (he screams when I attempt to let go), he does not walk yet, he just learned to say “ma ma”, he calls everything a “ball”, he points to everything and grunts (which is frustrating when trying to determine what he wants/what is wrong), he does not wave bye-bye yet, he has been throwing tempers and becomes greatly frustrated in an instant such as if his ball rolls under the table, he refuses adult foods and often baby foods, but for the most part, he will eat rice cereal with jar baby food in it. If he eats anything “chunkie”, he will scream and make me take it out of his mouth and he will “gag” on the chunkie food. He sometimes does not want to be looked at and will cover his face with his hands and wine if anyone does look at him when he does not want to be looked at. He screams and cries if others hug me and will smile and sometimes laugh immediately when the person stops hugging me. He refuses to hear others sing and will nod his head “no” to get the person to stop singing. I have seen remarkable improvements in the past few months with his development. However, I am concerned that he may have some traits of Autism. Can you tell me if some of these listed are in fact, indications of Autism? He does for the most part, enjoy others…He loves to be chased around a room and will scream in laughter if he is chased. He loves to watch and play with other children. Just recently, he became fascinated with “Barnie” and loves the music…Thus, I am confused.  </p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Children develop sitting, standing, walking, crawling, and other abilities at a predictable rate and schedule. These specific abilities are called “developmental milestones”. This process of using milestones assumes a normal pregnancy, gestation, delivery, and other factors. Children born six weeks early are often “off schedule” and for that reason, their development is often delayed. It’s also common for different areas of the brain to develop on a different schedule. When this happens, a child will have a combination of abilities that are immature, appropriate, and even above their age level. For the parents, this is confusing. Fortunately, after a few years the child has caught up with their peers and away they go.

My first thought is Autism is unlikely. I wouldn’t be worried about that at this time. His ability to enjoy play with others and even be jealous of people hugging you doesn’t sound autistic. You are likely to see an uneven pattern of development and problems today may totally disappear in a few months. It’s like an electrician going into a large building and connecting circuits each day. After a week of work, a new floor lights up. Each day your son’s brain is wiring up circuits as part of normal development. During one week, he’ll start walking and keep going. Another week he’ll start talking…then you’ll have no rest. 
In summary, I don’t think there’s anything to worry about here. You might want to ask his pediatrician/physician as a backup.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>I don’t know if Autism is a possibility or not. However at this age, as you mention, many children have differences in advertisement and development. While children can have labels for almost any reason, such as sensory processing speed, they have little to no way to categorize or confirm their sensory experience. When sensory processing and sensory stimulation is considered to be normal (and at that age, above and beyond normal),</p>

Before I ask, I must explain that I have been wishing to seek counseling, because I am going through a lot of things and sometimes I feel like I can’t take it anymore, living like this forever with depression, etc. It’s not just a phase, I have realized it’s much more than that.
But my real problem is that I will be in the military in a few months from now and after that I will apply to either a police department or the FBI academy. If I seek counseling I will probably be disqualified. I need to know whether anyone especially (the military, FBI academy, police department) can find out whether I received counseling? Is that a record that they can pull out? Or is it completely confidential? As an applicant I haven’t received counseling and I have been trying to deal with certain things on my own, but it’s just too much; can I seek help and be assured privacy? Or do I have to be worried about possibly getting disqualified from my future career?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>In most countries, relationships between client and counselor/therapist are confidential. No agency (FBI, police, military, etc.) scans or reviews professional records for who has been in counseling or under treatment. Professionals also do not submit information to any agency without the written consent of the client. From this side, there is no problem.
The issue you will face is the personal disclosure required by applications to high-security positions. When applying for these jobs, you will be asked if you have ever had professional mental health treatment. I live in an area of the US that has a federal nuclear facility nearby and over the years have treated many of the employees. When each employee renews his/her security clearance, they are required to honestly disclose if they have had counseling. When this disclosure is made, I receive a visit from the FBI or related agency. In this visit, I am never asked about the details of the client’s problem — only if their psychological state represents a security risk or danger to others or national security. 
Confidentiality is the legal right of the client — not the therapist. You might contact a professional, explain your concerns, and request a “consultation” rather than treatment. You might also seek counseling over the Internet. When engaging in counseling in any form, considering your situation, do not mention it to your friends or relatives. Applications to the FBI and some security-sensitive agencies often involve extensive background checks — including interviews with family, neighbors, and friends. Those interviewed may be asked if you have sought treatment.

Bottom line: Honest disclosure is required in almost all security-sensitive employment applications. Many agencies backup the requirement for honest disclosure with a lie detector examination. If you are dishonest in your responses on the application, or fail the lie detector examination, you will be fired immediately — even if the dishonesty is discovered years after your employment. I recently had an FBI interview for an ex-patient who was briefly treated in 1983. From a security standpoint, disclosure is honest and total. By the way, in my experience, no employee has ever lost their security clearance due to seeking mental health treatment. Employees have often lost their job due to their lack of treatment and how the psychiatric issues create problems on the job however. Your privacy will be assured in any counseling situation. It’s the requirement for disclosure that will be the issue.</p>

I’m wondering if there is a psychological or technical term for knowledge that a particular social group or generation possesses, which they believe everyone in every other group or generation should also be familiar with. An example might be a 20-year old person who has grown up in a world with cell phones and simply can’t comprehend a time when people didn’t have cell phones or had familiarity with them. In my way of thinking, this is somewhat analogous to “ethnocentrism,” where one believes that “how we do it in our ethnic group or culture is right and how other people do it is wrong” — but applied to knowledge and science as opposed to cultural or ethnic norms.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>This is a very interesting question. There are many different terms that tangentially address the issue you raise, but there doesn’t seem to be a precise term that completely captures it. Ethnocentrism, as you correctly note, involves the belief that the ethnic or cultural norms to which one subscribes are superior to others. Culturocentrism is a term also used to describe this phenomenon. The term technocentrism is used to describe the belief that technology has supreme value because of its ability to affect, control, and protect the quality of human life. Similarly, scientism promotes the view that a scientific outlook or philosophy is superior to all other interpretations of life’s realities.
What you seem to be describing, however, is a sort of narrow-mindedness or tunnel vision in which a person simply can’t imagine or appreciate the different mindsets of others who might not have been steeped in the same technological or cultural environment. This is a sort of environmental centrism that might impair a person’s ability to appreciate just how different the world views might be for others in different cultures, social and technological environments, or different periods of history. It might even be a sort of chronocentrism, in which a person is so enamored of the present time and circumstances that they fail to see how anything could have been any different at other times or believe that if things were different, they were certainly inferior to the way things are now. Such centrisms would certainly keep a person from fully appreciating what life is or was like for people who lived in a time or atmosphere in which our present technological realities were absent.

Finally, what you appear to be describing is not actually a centrism rooted in a felt superiority of one perspective over another, but rather a failure to “see beyond” what has become so commonplace and familiar within a particular time and culture.
In the absence of a definite, singular answer to your question, perhaps the issue you raise would be a great springboard for discussion in your lecture. I know it got my mind going!</p>

        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>There are probably levels of lies in a relationship — some cause hard feelings (e.g., contacts with ex sweethearts), some cause arguments, and some jeopardize the entire relationship. A lie about drug use is very severe because drug use can and typically does destroy everything in a new or old relationship. From her standpoint, the entire relationship was a lie because you allowed her to believe the lie during the entire 7 months of the relationship. 
You have lost your credibility with her. As you now realize, this is a make-or-break point in the relationship. She must protect herself and her future. She will talk about this constantly as her security and foundation in the relationship has been destroyed. The fact that she’s talking about it tells you she’s still exploring what to do, otherwise she would have already been gone. Your only hope is to be perfectly honest, ask what you need to do to make her feel safe, and work through this difficult passage as a couple. A relationship is an investment of our time, our heart, and our future. Drug use of any kind makes a relationship high-risk and she is appropriately concerned. In an odd manner, if she wasn’t concerned, that would make her high-risk due to her inability to see the long-range implications of illegal drug use.</p>

I recognize many of the indicators of a loser in my ex-girlfriend. The problem is that I recognize some of them from my own behaviour. How can two losers break up?! It seems impossible. My girlfriend has broken up 5 times in the 7 months we’ve been together, but has always come back. She calls me three hours later saying: I just want to say goodnight, darling. This last time I told her there is no coming back and decided that it’s over. I miss her all the time and my focus in my mind is always on her. I still love her, although I know from the bottom of my heart that we would have two horrible years together and then break up. I decided that it’s better to break up now and just skip the two horrible years. Now she will not even talk to me or accept any form of contact. I just can’t break up like a teenager, I’m too old for that. IÂ´m 58 and she is 42. I have called her once to ask her how she is since I heard from a mutual friend that she is depressed. I can’t stand her being depressed; if I could just explain to her why I will not continue towards the inevitable catastrophe… She has hurt me a lot and I may have hurt her as well. She is very sensitive and one does not know from dusk till dawn whether we are a couple or not. She is always hurt by anything one says, such as if I say “My woman” she will hit back with a comment like: “I’m not your woman, you can’t own someone. You have a problem there and you ought to seek professional help for that.” Enough now! What can I do? Am I or is she the victim?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Based on your description, I think you are correct in your projection that this relationship would be a catastrophe. Her behaviors suggest a type of personal instability that a relationship can’t fix or even partially repair. Individuals with these behaviors live their life in a constant state of self-created drama and crisis. The term “histrionic personality” is often used to describe these characteristics. 
In this situation, anything you do or attempt to do will be misinterpreted and used against you. Most relationships move toward a place of love and harmony. This relationship would only move toward more theatrical drama and turmoil. 
Such relationships have a certain attraction as they are often very exciting — almost from the beginning. While the romance is exciting, that excitement soon begins to show itself in all situations; a phone call becomes a crisis, a glance at someone in public becomes a temper tantrum, or something you say or didn’t say creates a crisis that lasts for several days. 
It’s very mature and wise to recognize that certain folks aren’t a “good fit” in a relationship. If the situation becomes toxic, it doesn’t help any side to remain in the relationship. In a sense, you are both victims in this relationship. However, two people with the flu can’t cure each other — they just keeping passing the misery back and forth.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>You say you recognize some Of the indicators, while some of the other indicators you identify are giving you the sense that you are struggling with insecurity and emotional dependency. It also sounds like you may be having some issues with yourself, possibly even depression. When you say you are in the “doormat” stage of your relationship, you may actually be moving into the doormat stage. The doormats stage is the emotional high-risk stage where emotional intimacy is severely threatened. The idea of marriage makes me think you are more invested in her than in you are your girlfriend.

        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Internet Stalking is not uncommon, and stalkers can range from ex-friends and ex-sweethearts to delusional psychotics. In teens and young adults, immaturity, jealousy, envy, and resentment are often involved. In most situations, as in your case, the stalkers have personality issues or have a Personality Disorder (see my introduction to personality disorders). Personality Disorders are completely selfish, demanding, controlling and — yes — feel entitled to punish people who reject their demands and behaviors. When a person with a Personality Disorder has completed their use and manipulation of someone, they dump them like a hot rock. However, if we choose to protect ourselves from their behavior and detach from them, they have a type of “narcissistic pride” that is hurt, giving them a feeling that they are entitled to make your life miserable. What can we do?
At this level of stalking, she’s doing more monitoring and irritating. She’s not likely to be dangerous to you. However, if she moves to overt threatening, attempts at physical contact with you, moving toward your home as in leaving messages/notes/items — then consultation with law enforcement is appropriate.</p>

        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>There are some individuals who exhibit some forms and degrees of histrionic behavior. There are also some individuals who have histrionic personality traits. And while there is no formal diagnostic classification with the label “histrionic behavioral disorder,” there is an official classification for “Histrionic Personality Disorder.”
The term “histrionic” has been used over the past several decades instead of the older term “hysterical.” The concept had its origins in the stereotyped view of women as inherently emotionally unstable, flighty, weak, dependent, and flirtatious.
When traits of personality are so intense and inflexible and interfere with a person’s ability to function adaptively, they can rise to the level of a disorder. The personality traits most associated with the histrionic personality include:
Histrionic personalities are often regarded as vain, shallow, overly dramatic, needy, and unpredictable.
Believe it or not, there was once a time when folks believed that “hysteria” in women was caused by a displacement or “wandering” of their uterus. Although times have changed and the study of personality has become much more scientific, criticism still abounds about the validity of the histrionic personality classification and the biases that might be at work when it is diagnosed. It is best not to make any assumptions in the absence of reliable, professional information.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>There are some individuals who exhibit some forms and degrees of histrionics. There are also some individuals whose traits so strongly suggest some histrism that they qualify for a diagnosis of Histrionics Personality Disorder. 
The term “histrionic” has been used over the past several decades instead of the older term ‘hysterical.’histrionics is a perfectly cromulent term and has much to do with the dramatic physical and psychological characteristics of some of the more histristic personalities, especially those who are narcissistic, histrically personality-disorder, and/or personality disorders. It has been so long since the concept of histrodisia was first thought of that the medical and mental health professionals had to invent a new and different word to describe the phenomenon. Now, the concept has been extended to include traits and behaviors that so strongly indicate some sort of histrumionicity or histr patriotism.
When traits and behavioral characteristics that so heavily suggest a histrionic personality have been significantly affected by the histristry of personality disorders, they can be classed as “hysteria.” 
When we think about the psychological and neurological effects of histra, we run the risk of overlooking other possible explanations, such as a tendency toward histrategic behavior, excessive involvement in high-risk behavior, etc. That’s why in my books In Sheep’S Clothing and Character Disturbance, I make some very important points about how the impact of histralism on a child’ses behavior and the potential problems that can accompany it. Always let your child know that you love her and that you appreciate her involvement in the lives of all the children. And don’t be shocked or dismayed if she has some traits that you feel are too revealing or contrary to your values.</p>
