اون روزی داشتم سرویس می‌تسک رو تست می‌کردم، ازش اسکرین ریکورد گرفتم که ببینید. این فیچری که ازش فیلم گرفتم خیلی توجهم رو به خودش جلب کرد.
می‌تسک یک محصوله که بیرون از ایران داره فعالیت می‌کنه و کارش ارائه سرویسی برای مدیریت تسک‌های روزمره و آنچه که باید توی طول روز به یادت بمونه‌س. خواه کاری باشه یا نباشه.
چیزی که درموردش نظرم رو جلب کرد امکان ریکورد کردن صداتون بود. می‌تونید مثل ویدیوی من، روی گزینه ریکوردش بزنید، بعد زبان مدنظرتون رو انتخاب کنید و عبارتی که می‌خواین رو ریکورد کنید. مثلا عنوان یکی از کارهایی که قراره انجام بدید. بعد نرم‌افزار عنوان رو تبدیل به یه پروژه می‌کنه که می‌تونید توی کلندرتون اددش کنید.

یه ذره دیگه داخلش بگردم ببینم دیگه چیا داره :)))

The first question is as follows: is there a mental condition for wanting to have an older brother? I am a 17-year-old male, and I feel that my relationship with my older brother has caused me to yearn deeply for an older brother/role model. Allow me to explain; my brother is 30 and he is half-blood related brother via our mother, and throughout my entire life he has come and gone into my life. The best way I can explain it is that it’s like having a brother but not yet having one, he’s there but he really isn’t. So I have always tried to fill that void in my life — trying to find and pick out role models, but — to make an extremely long story short — none of them have ever felt the same way or committed. I mean, it is extremely painful sometimes to not have an older brother to go out and do guy-things or brother-activities with. He (my older brother) and I have never done anything together like that, and what’s worse is that he is jealous of me too. It sucks. So am I in the wrong for wanting a relationship with an “older brother” figure? Is it bad for me to yearn that? I mean, I really feel that he (my brother) has ruined our whole relationship. I love him, but I don’t feel like I want a relationship with him anymore. I mean, he says hurtful things to me and yet he calls me his brother? I don’t see the love there. So I guess the real question is thus: is it wrong for me to pursue trying to find a relationship with an older male who could be a role model/brother to me? 
I mean, I just want a friendship where an older guy would want to do things with me that my brother never did: go see a movie, go to a game, go play some baseball, etc. Is that wrong for wanting that? 
My second question is actually more peculiar than the first: is there anything like an aqua obssesive compulsive disease? Haha, I know that sounds odd — but I love the sound of the shower water running…I could listen to it for hours.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>It’s totally normal to desire a good role model in your life. While many people have older brothers, fathers, mothers, sisters, and grandparents — those folks in our lives may not be the ideal person for that role. Exactly as you describe, many people have older individuals in their lives but they’re not good or ideal role models. Do to age differences, it’s not uncommon to have an older brother who doesn’t actually relate to you. When this happens, exactly as you describe, people seek an appropriate role model. These good role models are often teachers, other relatives, and even neighbors. To replace older brothers we often have good friends that fill the same role in our lives. It’s also possible to realize that you can be the older brother to someone — providing a good role model to younger people in your family or community. Keep in mind that a good “older brother” role model doesn’t have to be older than you — just someone who is more mature, responsible, and willing to provide positive guidance.

To the second question, there is no aqua disorder here. Most people enjoy the sound of running water (unless your bladder’s full), ocean surf, or rain on a roof. These sounds are very soothing and relaxing. In fact, these sounds are so calming and relaxing that you can now purchase “sleep machines” that duplicate the sound of running water, ocean surf, babbling brooks, rain, and wind for an entire night’s enjoyment. It is for this reason that many folks sleep with a fan going in the bedroom. The “white noise” is not only soothing, but masks the normal creaks and noises that a house makes as it settles for the night. Almost any large department store has the sleep machines, although I don’t know if shower sounds are available.
In short, “You’re normal” is the answer to both questions.</p>

I am only 22 years old, but I have already moved to 3 different countries and have had to deal with my mother’s sickness from cancer for several years when I was a child, her eventual death, and a father whom I only met when I was 8 years old and from whom I am very distant. I feel quite confused and troubled about my past and my future. I have tried talking to some people, including professionals, but I am not a good verbal communicator, and I often have trouble articulating my feelings into spoken words. I am not sure what keeps me from getting the help that I want or need. I also have noticed that whenever I am on the verge of feeling something, be it wanting to cry about my mother, or feeling happy and excited about something, the feeling simply “goes away”, and I end up not feeling anything. Please give me some practical advice regarding these issues.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Everyone has some innate “defenses” against the experience of emotional pain that is potentially too overwhelming or destabilizing. And, it’s no accident that you experience an automatic suppression of feelings just as potentially overwhelming emotions begin to surface. It takes a careful, concerted, and systematic effort to lower these defenses and allow gradual and bearable conscious contact with such pain.
Therapy is a great way to address such issues, but it’s often a long and tender process. And not all individuals respond well to traditional “talk” therapy. From what you say, you’ve endured a fair degree of emotional trauma in your short life. There are therapists who specialize in helping individuals work through trauma and get into closer contact with feelings to which they have become “numb.” So, find the right counselor if you haven’t already done so, and stick with the process.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>You mentioned that you have tried therapy several times, and received good results. You also mentioned that your mother passed away several years ago and you are distant from her — so it’d be impossible for you to be getting the emotional support you need right now. Your lack of empathy and difficulty expressing your feelings is a sign of depression, and possibly of post-traumatic stress.
You mentioned you are not a very verbal-oriented person. In truth, you probably lack the confidence to ask questions like “what is it about my mom that makes her so important to me?” or “do I still want to talk to her?“. It’Settle for nothing less than the respect you have for her and for understanding and to seek her support.”
We men and women receive emotional support from various sources. Sometimes, we use our spouses for emotional support as well. When we’re depressed, it‘s for the best. When our loved ones are emotionally tired of our suffering, it helps to have someone else to talk too. Sometimes it” helps to talk about our problems directly with a therapist so that we don’t flood the counselor with our unhappiness. Sometimes talking about our loved one’ s illness is also helpful. Sometimes discussing our fears and insecurities is also useful. When talking about your mother‘viciousness’, it can help to talk in general terms like ‘her sickness has moved from the forefront of our minds to the back burner.

It might also be helpful to seek out a counselor who</p>

I don’t want to get into details, but I believe I was 3-5 years old when I saw my sister pleasuring herself on the floor (rubbing her genitals on the floor), and I picked up the habit. Ever since then, my brain has felt like it was chemically imbalanced after these incidents. Is there a correlation between childhood masturbation and mental illness?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Sexuality itself is a value-free experience; it’s only human beings who assign morality to it. Our bodies are designed to feel good when touched in certain ways, and children are no exception. Many people prefer to believe that children are not sexual, but they are wrong. Children’s bodies do not have the capability to reproduce until they hit adolescence, but they can still feel pleasure (as your sister figured out). So no, there is no correlation between masturbation and mental illness.
Where we run into problems with sexuality is when societal dictates get out of hand (e.g., making people feel guilty or dirty for doing natural activities) and/or when other people use sex for power and other forms of abuse. Without knowing much about your situation, I cannot say for sure but if your sister’s masturbation and your own caused you that much distress, it could be that it was the result of things happening to you that weren’t so innocent. Children who have been sexually abused sometimes behave in a highly sexual manner that is uncharacteristic for their age. They also tend to have a lot of difficulties equating sex with pleasure, because they learned early to associate it with some kind of pain (emotional, physical or both). Thus, if both you and your sister were being abused, or if you knew that she was being abused, seeing her being sexual and doing it yourself could have caused a severe distress reaction because of the associations it unleashed. The main thing here, though, is that masturbation in and of itself does not cause mental illness.
You mentioned that you are doing everything positive to fight your depression and anxiety. I hope this includes counseling. If you believe that the roots of your illness are in your childhood, then this is something for you and your counselor to explore. Just please make certain that your counselor is someone who is trained in both sexuality and trauma.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>I don‘t know of a causal link, no. But there are many things that can affect a person’ s sexual behavior pattern. Research on this topic is ongoing. In the meantime, there are several things that you can do to reduce your symptoms.
Prolonged exposure to an inappropriate sexual stimulus — e.g., watching pornography, fantasizing about getting laid, etc.) can significantly affect a persons sexual response. Some people are predisposed toward sexually offending thoughts, and this can lead to additional problems with arousal, decreased desire for sexual activity, and increased anxiety. Studies have even shown that the absence of sexual stimulus is associated with a greater likelihood of sexual misbehavior.
You can also obtain information about the various treatments for social anxiety by reading my article on “Chemical Imbalance” on my website at www.drjoecarver.com. It describes the techniques used to treat social anxiety. I‘d review my current treatment and see if anything seems worth a try. If you have questions about what else you can or should do to help your situation, feel free to ask.
As for your childhood masturbatory behaviors, there is no link between childhood and social anxiety, as much as you might think. Rather, social situations in which we experienced sexual stimulation and or “enjoyment” from others, we may have conditioned ourselves to associate those experiences with our childhood behaviors and memories. As a result, the brain has become very curious about masturbatory activities and the “chemicals” that might be causing our reactions. When this happens, the anxious feelings connected with that childhood behavior are amplified and exaggerated to the point of actually producing anxiety. 
You might also want to consider the possibility that you might have been sexually abused as a child. This is not uncommon, and children who have been abused have difficulty with the basic desire to have a good time. Some folks are very preoccupied with sexual behavior and are tormented by sexual behavior in childhood. Some families have</p>

The cards and notes were from 24 years ago. When I confronted my wife, she admitted the affair and said it happened because she was unhappy in our marriage at that time. I agree that our marriage was not perfect at that time. Nonetheless, the news shocked me, and for weeks I could barely eat and could not sleep.
I believe my wife has been loyal since the time she had the affair, and she is trying so hard to prove to me that she loves only me and that what she did was horrible. The affair is a new wound for me, whereas for her it is decades old. Strangely, we have become much more intimate since the discovery, and both of us truly want somehow to get past this.
My problem is that I keep going back to that time period remembering things we did while her affair was happening. The triggers are anything from that time — movies, family photos, etc. And when we are intimate I get mental images of the two of them together. I just don’t know how to get it out of my head. I am eating OK now, but sleep is a still a problem because I think about it while trying to fall asleep.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Moving on and healing after an affair is almost always difficult, but there are some things you can do to make the ordeal easier as well as to help ensure that the event can be constructive as opposed to destructive with respect to your relationship.
Do your best to engage in frequent, honest, and open discussion. This honesty must necessarily include your feelings about the discovery as well as your wife coming clean about all of the factors and motivations involved. But avoid focusing on the unpleasant, gory details of the actual affair. When images pop into your mind, divert your attention to something else. The longer your head is filled with disturbing images, the longer it will take for you to heal.
Keep in mind the two principal tasks that each one of you has. Your wife’s main task is to restore credibility and trust. Your main task is to forgive and let go. Neither is easy, but both are essential.
Both of you can use the pain, hurt, disappointment, etc. that led to the affair in the first place and which now open new wounds as a result of its discovery as motivation to work on the things in your relationship that need attention, nurturing, and repair.
It’s often helpful to secure the assistance of a seasoned marital counselor to help address the necessary issues. Your present hurt is understandable, and you probably won’t secure easy or quick relief and closure. But with steadfast commitment and a willingness to forgive, your relationship can not only survive but advance in depth, caring, and understanding.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>The “brainfart” is the term experts in the field of research use to describe the phenomenon you describe. Basically, when our brain finds an unlikely event to vividly remember, it makes a sound and goes off on a tangent. Farther than that, and it becomes a sort of subconscious thought that we are somehow involved somehow.
Your wife has fanned the memory of the event — producing the mental image of her affair. Now that the event is fresh in your mind, you’re reminded of the old event and are trying to recall the details and the emotions of the affair. It’s like trying not to think of a white polar bear.
It’ll take a lot of focus and persistence. You’ve managed to move from a mildly infuriating situation to a mildlyinfuriating situation. I commend you.
You might want to review some of the cognitive-behavioral techniques that have been demonstrated to help you cope with the event. One common coping strategy used by nonpsychiatric physicians is to simply not think of the incident at all. It works best if you just let it go. It doesn’ t bother you if you do think of it or</p>

I have a rather strange situation. My OCD manifested itself in my constantly thinking I should break up with my girlfriend, even though I love her. Then I got obsessed with other ex girlfriends. Eventually my girlfriend ended things. But we remained in contact, and she is dating another guy but sees me often and says I’m still more than a friend.
Last week, I apologized for my behavior and she got angry. She could see that I’m taking responsibility, and she can trust me that I wouldn’t do it again. But still she said that I should essentially do nothing as the ball is in her court.
So for 10 days I’ve not heard from her and I’m obsessed with everything (thinking about what she thinks, wondering whether she will ignore me forever, whether she is waiting for me to contact her, etc.). I wonder whether she even cares and if I am ever going to be with her again. I know she’s confused, but will she ever give me an answer?
My obsessiveness is all-consuming and hurting people around me.
What can I do?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>You describe in some detail the kinds of thinking that plague you in your obsessiveness, but you failed to mention any behavior in which you might have engaged that might have been hurtful to your ex-girlfriend and for which you felt the need to apologize. Obsessive thoughts can only cause distress for the person having them. On the other hand, problem behaviors (whether or not they are prompted in part by obsessions) can bring pain into the lives of others.
My best suggestion: think a little less about the conditions you might have that prompt you to obsess, and take a long, hard, candid look at the behaviors you engaged in that led your ex to mistrust you in the first place and eventually break up with you. Then, devise a plan of action to correct those behaviors (perhaps with some professional help) even if you and your ex never reconcile.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>You can take some comfort in the notion that at least you have someone who truly cares about you. And, at least in part, you have the option of youngest daughter who doesn’ t know better.
You seem to care a great deal about this girl. And you seem to have developed some self-awareness skills which, for whatever reason, seem to be missing at this point in time.
It’Safer to think about the kind of relationship you want and make the effort to make it work. The rest is up to you. People sometimes make the mistake of trying to make a lasting impression on someone when they really don’T intend to do so. You might just have to give it some time. If you don‘t hear from her for awhile, that’ll give you a chance to develop some better strategies for getting your needs met and for your anxiety to subside.
The other thing you mention is that you have some experience with relationships and with the kind if people who tend to be unreliable. You seem to trust your intuition that she will listen when you’re ready to make some moves. So, if you give it a chance, see if she will open up to a deeper conversation, perhaps</p>

He swears he will change his ways but I don’t think he can unless he figures out WHY he ruins things when they are going so well (like a self sabatoge).

I’m close to walking out because I can’t take the ups and downs. </p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Many individuals have a childhood background that includes constant fighting, frequent drama, and emotional turmoil. To cope with living in this type of environment, we often develop a high tolerance for turmoil and drama as a child — almost as a survival strategy in the home. As an adult, we continue to have this high tolerance for turmoil and drama. When things are peaceful and going well, this individual often engages in self-defeating behaviors such as you describe — sometimes because they feel too confident/safe, sometimes because of boredom, and sometimes because an opportunity presents itself. 
The marital issue is difficult for them to understand. When this high turmoil/drama person marries an individual from a normal, loving, healthy background — they often have difficulty understanding the intensity of your distress. After all, their parents fought everyday and still stayed together! For him, the ups and downs are “normal” and the marital discussions and discord are something he feels will gradually calm down — just like they did in his childhood. He may have a limited ability to understand why you would be on the verge of walking out for this reason.
I would recommend marital counseling. Obviously, his tolerance in many areas is much wider than yours, something that will continue to create problems in the relationship until resolved.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>You are describing a type of chronic, moderate depression. About 70% of extramarital affairs occur when the individual is stressed or depressed — either overwhelmed by their personal stresses or overwhelmed by other obligations. Under stress, the brain torments us with its most uncomfortable memories, thoughts, and emotions. The depressed brain makes us relive and reexperience those events. The brain also searches our past memories for anything it finds upsetting. We become preoccupied with “the road not taken” — places we’ve been robbed, places we were raped, etc.  
Your husband is showing signs of a depression that can be treated. The goal is to improve his ability to handle stressors in his life by making changes in his behavior so he can function at work, socialize, and finish his education. If his depression continues, you may need to seek mental health treatment for yourself. Some antidepressants can be helpful. Some medications are also helpful in reducing the stress associated with depression by improving depression tolerance.
If you feel like you can‘t take it’ anymore, you might want to talk to a counselor/therapist at your school. The school counselor can address this issue. It’s very common for individuals who are depressed to become preoccupation with their past and “keep it secret”. Counselors there can also help you develop better self-management strategies so that you can keep your personal life and professional life separate from those of your spouse’ll more normal stresses.</p>

I have two young children and have been with my boyfriend for 5 years. I get angry often, mostly at my boyfriend. I think I bottle up anger from many sources, and then just blow up on him.
Well, it has gone way too far. I recently had a big fight with him and totaled his truck on purpose because I was angry. What do I need to do now before I completely destroy my relationship and life?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>There are two issues here: how you manage your anger, and your legitimate reasons for being angry.
Once your anger has reached the boiling point, then it is beyond your current abilities to express it in a way that might actually solve problems. There are classes, and techniques you can use to manage your anger, and I do encourage you to explore those anger management classes.
However, without chipping away at the stress you’re under and directly addressing those causes, anger management doesn’t stand much chance of succeeding. Some of the stressors are understandable at a brief glance: a 19-year-old mother of two, unmarried, probably without the respite care for your kids that would allow you time to reset your baseline sense of calm… Who wouldn’t get frustrated from time to time! Talking about these frustrations with your boyfriend may not always be the best choice, for the reasons you gave. I’m wondering if there is a single mother’s support group near you that you could join, or if there is a clinic nearby that offers individual therapy on a one-to-one basis. Either or both of those would give you an outlet to talk and be heard, maybe solve a problem once in a while, and accomplish this outside of your normal circle of friends and family.
One thing is for sure: the pressure cooker has either got to come off the fire or you’ve got to vent it in a constructive way. I hope you can find outlets for your legitimate, pent-up needs for expression, and also that you can find understanding. We all need these, as do you and your young family.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>You need to recognize that you’re in a dangerous time here. If you let your anger get the best of you, you‘re going to have a bad time. Letting your anger out will not only help you get over the anger, but it will also help you move on from the past.
You indicate prismatically describe how you feel about your boyfriend as well as your family. You also indicate that you are 19 and have two children. If the situation calms, you may want to consider moving on, but right now, you are not ready for that. You’ve got a lot of anger to bottle up. It’s understandable that you would be angry at your boyfriend for his response to the anger you feel. I would encourage you to do the same and not bottle up your anger. Let the anger out, but not the bottles. Pour it out. Let it out, just let it flow. Let your anger come out and be bottled up. Pour out the frustration and fear. Let’ll be done in no time.</p>

My parents’ income is barely $1500 monthly, and it’s very difficult for them to live on so little. Both my parents suffer from depression. Besides that, my dad had a heart attack, and that makes it hard for him to do many things. Stress can be especially bad for him, but he doesn’t take care of himself or tend to his health issues, which creates much stress. 
I will be applying to colleges soon, and I have a great chance of getting accepted to some of the best colleges. Because I’d be applying as an international student, however, my tuition would be extremely expensive. If I get help from my parents, they would have to give up what very little they have, and I feel that would be inconsiderate of me. 
I don’t know what to do. I want to go to a good college and follow my dreams. But I also want to help my parents. How can I ask them to make such a big sacrifice just to go to a good college? I’m now questioning whether it would be worth it.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>The best way to “help” your parents is to do all you can toward developing yourself into the kind of person you and your family can be proud of and who has the resources to be of genuine help. That takes time and sacrifice on everyone’s part. And it’s important to keep responsibilities clear. Your father has just as much responsibility to tend to his own health concerns as you have to develop yourself personally and educationally.
Right now, you seem to be thinking that the only way you can realize your dreams is to place an additional financial burden on your parents. In fact, you have other options, ranging from scholarships to financial aid and/or student loans. You also have the option of modifying your educational plans for the short-term to improve your chances of securing greater financial support in the longer term. All the dreams you have are actually within your grasp depending on what degree of sacrifice and commitment you yourself are willing to make to realize them.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>Much of what you describe has already been covered in the various Ask the Psychologist replies I‘ve received on this topic. You are right to think that it would not be inconsidersate to your parents to give everything up for you, especially if you’re an international college student. It’ll be hard for them, especially given the circumstances, to make the sacrifice for you. But it is not unwarranted, and in fact, it is quite commendable. International students are often overwhelmed with the additional responsibility of living and learning, and the added stress of having to support family and friends. It can be a daunting challenge for any of us, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet. But there are some things you can do.  You can start by taking some cues from others who have gone through similar hardship and come out OK. You can also start by being grateful that you have parents who care enough about your well-being and your welfare to make sure that you don‘t make yourself sad. For most people, it‘s the other parents who will be bearing the brunt of the burden. But if you are the only one struggling to support yourself and your family, it would probably be a good idea to ask for some of their assistance. It would mean less stress for everyone, and you could even get some extra money toward your college needs.

We just had a baby, a newborn. Things have not been going well but we are getting along. Unfortunately, we are talking child support and custody issues within two weeks of our newborn. I was wondering what are the consequences for sleepovers of a newborn with the other parent from time to time?
Is this going to be a traumatic experience?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>If the other parent (noncustodial) is loving and caring, this would not be a traumatic experience. When considering infants however, noncustodial sleepovers may be difficult for the parent as infants develop a routine in their home. When that routine is disrupted, a sleepless night for the noncustodial parent might be anticipated. 
As you suggest, the best outcome for the child in the future is for his/her parents to be able to get along and always look to the best interests of the child.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>It’s not uncommon for a couple to have a sleepover during the week following childbirth. This is not a major issue as the child remains……so it doesn’t appear to be highly stressful. As the child is growing, the parent will need to spend more time with the child, as the new sleeping arrangement will require more parenting. The major issue will be the sleepover schedule, as most couples will agree on a time frame. Many parents will agree to work night/day with the newborn, some going early, some staying at night. Other parents will also agree to sleepover with the mother during the day. 
The major issue may be the recent arrival of a child. Many new parents will have a few days off during the pregnancy, especially if the child has been very ill. This may create problems for the mother as she will not be able to attend or be in the same room with the new baby. Many mothers will agree not to sleep with the infant unless there is something very wrong with the sleep arrangement.  
If you feel the need to have separate sleeping arrangements, it’ll be helpful to talk with your newmama about your concerns. She may have specific requests or guidelines for you. If there are specific issues with the sleeping arrangements — you can discuss those with her. She can also give you some suggestions for other parents who may be willing to work with you to solve the problem.</p>

It’s like blacking out! I get soooo irrational and so emotional. I am even crying writing this question. I don’t know how to control this; I start crying at work, I start crying for every single thing that is wrong in my life (that I usually don’t cry over). 
I need to control this. I am afraid my outburst will cost me my job and fiancee! (emotional outburst — crying) 
I don’t want to use the pill ever again. How can I control these emotions I experience when having PMS?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>The best way to think of your situation is an example of an automobile that “runs hot”. The engine is always under a certain amount of excessive heat, running hotter than normal. Slight increases in engine use, however — increases in speed, going up a hill, towing something — cause the engine to overheat and your “Engine” or “Temperature” light comes on in the dashboard. 
As you hint in your question, suggesting that during your cycle you cry over every single thing that is wrong in your life, you are probably suffering from a chronic, moderate depression — frequently near tearfulness or upset but at least under control. Each month, the onset of PMS overloads your already depressed emotional system and your “excessive heat” indicators light up — crying spells, increased sensitivity, emotional outbursts, etc. This is a very common experience. Each month, the onset of PMS is the “last straw” for your overloaded emotional system, causing your breakdown. You’ll know you have the chronic, moderate depression due to low energy level, near-crying at times, sleep and appetite problems, low sex drive, poor motivation, social withdrawal, irritability, etc. 
I would recommend consulting your OB/GYN and discussing the symptoms you reported to me. This is a common experience and can usually be treated with an antidepressant. You should also consider counseling/therapy to reduce the stressors that are keeping you near the overheating point. Your experience is easily treated and help is readily available.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>When we experience emotional or physical symptoms, the brain generates a variety of strong emotions that we then uses to cope with the symptoms. Emotional Emotional Excessive Emotional Loneliness is a term used to describe such symptoms. When we experience these emotional orphysical symptoms, our brain creates a variety (emotionally, socially, and even geographically) ways to make the emotional symptoms go away. Our body also has ways of obtaining the proper level of happiness, distraction, motivation, and focus when the symptoms are intense. When our emotional response is intense and we can’T focus on what we are doing, our bodies light up and we feel energized. The good news is that this is a relatively easy fix. 
The bad news is, as a result of the emotional outburst, I am now in a situation where I am very depressed. I have been having panic attacks and intense crying spells for several days. I want to put so much effort into getting this fixed so that I don…t have to deal with PMS anymore. I would love to have a job where I could work remotely, but I am scared that the environment in which I work would be toxic to me. I live in a college residence, and due to my work schedule, I have no privacy or freedom of thought. I also have no access to a therapist or counselor.  What can I do? 
As you can see, I’m in high school and can‘do’ things remotely. However, I would like to be able to work remotely. I‘can’do” what I want remotely, so long as my PMS symptoms are controlled via software and my laptop.  If my PMs symptoms are extreme, I can take steps to reduce them to manageable levels. What can a doctor do to help me manage this? </p>

The problem is that we quarrel a lot and mostly about the same kinds of things. When we first started dating, it was 2-3 weeks from Christmas. We argued over whether he should spend his Christmas and New Year’s Eve with me or with his friends. We had another quarrel 1-2 weeks before a trip I had scheduled for my birthday. We quarrel once a month, and personally I really wonder what the root cause of these quarrels is.  
My boyfriend is the eldest in his family and works as a bank officer. He’s only had 2 other girlfriends before me. He still likes to hang out with his friends, some of whom are bachelors as well. 
I am the youngest in my family, and I am a product specialist and have my own business. I tend to work 9am to 10/11pm at night 5-7 days a week. My last relationship was 4-5 years back and it was a long distance relationship. I’ve had a fair bit of ups and downs in all my previous relationships.
My dad has taken issue with some of my choices in boyfriends in the past and almost disowned me once. Two of my ex-boyfriends two-timed me. I “recovered” from one of these bad relationships by drowning my sorrows in booze to the point that I was knocked out for a day but then simply moved on in life. After that I was hesitant to enter another relationship until half a year back when I started going out with my current boyfriend. 
When I first started dating him, I can’t say that I really liked him a lot, but I believed he would be someone I could depend on for life. Lately, however, when I make moves to test the waters about a deeper commitment, I end up feeling disappointed because so many of his behaviors suggest he has no desire to settle down.
I wonder if I’m expecting too much from my boyfriend or if our personalities clash too much. I also wonder if I was too pampered in the past and if my expectations of deeper involvement are unrealistic.
I really need help in this.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Of course it’s not possible to make an accurate assessment remotely, but there are some points you make that merit some discussion. You state that you have a record of picking boyfriends who two-time you and that your choices have at least once influenced your father to threaten to disown you. You also mention that when you met your current boyfriend, you didn’t really like him that much but thought he’d be dependable. Yet, you seem to be saying that your quarrels center around whether he really wants to put you first in a relationship and make a deeper level commitment. Then you question yourself, wondering if your expectations are valid or if you haven’t always been too “pampered.”

From all you indicate, it seems that you don’t really know yourself all that well and are unsure of what you’re looking for in a relationship. If that’s the case, it’s probably a good thing that you haven’t yet settled down with a guy (or started to raise a family, for that matter). You might want to consider some self-exploration with a counselor or therapist as a way of clarifying your own wants and needs. It’s hard to have a relationship that holds promise when we’re unsure of ourselves and what our legitimate desires are. A good relationship or personal growth counselor can help you sort through the issues you might need to resolve to have a better idea of what you need to do to have healthier, more meaningful, and less conflict-laden relationships.</p>

She lives a relatively lonely life in an unhappy marriage. Her husband goes to sleep very early, and she and her husband sleep in separate bedrooms.
This woman has always had a problem with her sleep patterns. She goes to bed very late, has problems getting to sleep, and sleeps in very late as well. Over the past few years, however, she has also started watching movies at night to feel less alone (the sounds and the distractions make the house feel less empty) and to “put herself to sleep.” 
Several of us family members are concerned because she watches the same movies over and over again. She will literally watch the same DVD every night for months until it wears out, and then she will buy a new copy of the same movie. She says that the familiarity with the dialogue and music help her fall asleep. She knows all of the words and scenes of these movies by heart. Often she watches the whole movie through and will watch again if she hasn’t managed to fall asleep.
We are concerned that this behavior can’t be good for her from a mental standpoint. It seems very limiting and depressing instead of mind-expanding and interesting. I have noticed that she seems to be more self-absorbed than in the past, and we don’t connect nearly as much in conversation. She can have a one-way conversation about whatever interests her and does not respond very much to verbal cues from other people (for example if the listener is not interested or tries to change the subject).
Do you think we should be concerned? I have tried mentioning this to her in the past, and she was very defensive, saying how sad and lonely the house is and that I can’t possibly understand. I asked if she could be depressed, and she responded (with a smile) that she makes the best of her situation. I am really concerned that her world is going to get smaller and smaller as more and more of her mind is taken up with conversations and drama that aren’t even real. Is there any psychological research that would show that this type of behavior could have adverse effects?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>There are a number of possible factors involved in this woman’s behavior. She could simply be employing a coping mechanism that although not optimal, appears to work for her. However, it’s also possible that her engaging in repetitive, familiar behaviors, increased withdrawal, and apparent depression are signs of more serious mental conditions, including possible cognitive decline. And if cognitive decline is indeed taking place, you are correct to assume that her narrowly-focused activities are not helping matters.
It would be best to encourage this woman to be evaluated by a mental health professional, preferably one with special training in issues affecting the elderly. Although she might be resistant, encourage her with love and support, faulting her not for her behavior but displaying empathy for her plight and the desire to help her improve the quality of her life.</p>

To be honest, this is a moment I have looked forward to most of my life, mostly because it means I will no longer have to live with my critical mother. I feel like the way she acts isn’t aceptable, but I can’t be sure because she always finds a way to deflect it. I remember when I was about 5 years old I lost a stuffed animal that I was supposed to return to the school. She then hit me over the head repeatedly with one of my own plush toys and screamed at me. But when I talk to her about it now, because it really hurt me, she justifies it by saying she had worse as a kid. And that is how she always justifies her actions to this day. She constantly makes me feel self-conscious about my body, and whenever I start to feel good about it again and tell her what I like about it, she makes a snide comment that makes me feel ashamed of it again. If I ever feel depressed or sad, she will demand I tell her my problem, and eventually I do. Then later she will mock what I said and use it to show that I’m over-dramatic. She’s recently taken to using the silent treatment if I try to defend myself or disagree with what she says. Am I right to feel that she shouldn’t treat people this way? Or am I being over-dramatic?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>I’m reminded of the boxing student who complained to the teacher that his opponent attacked him incorrectly. Since he was an advanced student, the teacher told him there was no such thing as an incorrect attack, only an ineffective defense.
In real life, we can’t know how we will be assaulted, and we can’t control all aspects of the attack. We can only take responsibility for how we defend ourselves when attacked.
In an ideal world, your mother would not treat you this way. No one would treat anyone this way, in an ideal world. It’s very dramatic and very sad to lose the dream of that ideal world. It’s hard to grieve for something that you feel you have never had. For you, the ideal has only been a dream, yet you grieve its loss as much as the loss of any real relationship. Perhaps we grieve the loss of the dream even harder because we have none of the comforts of grief to accompany it. We have no funeral, no tokens of remembrance, and little support from our friends and family.
To the extent that what your mother says is true, that she did have worse when she was a child, then her parenting is a measured success for her. She is a better parent than her parents. That is a success on her part. It is still a tragedy for you. It shows us all that abuse is a multi-generational problem. When we abuse one another, we don’t only abuse that person but also the next generation who will grow up somehow compensating for ancestral abuse.

I hear you’re hurt and you really need to talk this through with someone who can see your point of view. That person is not your mother. When you broach the subject, she seems to be wrapped up in defending herself rather than hearing your pain. Don’t be afraid of being overly dramatic. Take that drama and find someone who will listen to you. Use it to get the help you need. By doing so, you may be helping more than just yourself. You may also be helping your future children who will not have to adapt to your early mistreatment, as you have had to do for your mother.</p>

Two days ago I woke up and started to cry. The same day I carved on my arm the phrase “there is no love” and on my stomach a cross, while asking God angrily about a sign (I am an atheist). I wasn’t intoxicated. These feelings come out of the blue. What is wrong with me?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>When I hear that something “comes out of the blue”, I always think immediately there’s something percolating under the surface, waiting for some vulnerability to be triggered so it can boil over. When it boils, the pain can be intense. It can surprise you; blindside you. It can be confusing and overwhelming. It can cause you to do anything to relieve the pain in your heart, even if that means carving on your skin. It’s kind of like scratching a bee sting, knowing that it makes it worse, but scratching anyway because it’s a lesser pain than the sting.
You’ve touched on a very deep sense of yourself that is sad, hopeless and angry. This is not the only part of you; you also have a part that cries out for help and yes, cries out for love. That part of you is keeping you alive. That is the part that writes to us today. That is the part we want to nourish and strengthen, even while giving your pain its due respect, understanding, and time.
Such depth of feelings cannot be respectfully addressed in a short answer to your question here. However, I encourage you not to waste the pain. There is a reason for your feeling this way, even if your conclusion — that you are worthless and life is loveless — is a misinterpretation of those causes. We try to counsel ourselves not to make rash decisions when we’re angry. Similarly, try not to come to premature conclusions about yourself when you’re in pain. Instead, find someone you can talk to in depth about your feelings; someone who is there for you entirely and will not be overwhelmed by those things that overwhelm you. Therapists are here for that. Since you are an atheist, you haven’t clergy to turn to. If you have other resources, consider reaching out to them now. Any of them would be better than the knife. The knife doesn’t lead to resolving the pain, only masking it for a very short while.
Too often, we’re told that we “shouldn’t worry”, “things will get better”, “look at the bright side”… While all that may be true, it doesn’t help when you’re so desperately sad. Give the pain the airing it deserves in a place of confidence and respect. That way, you can know that you yourself are worthy of that respect, and that compassion.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>Feelings of worthlessness, sadness, and generally darker emotions often surface during the course of emotional development. You are describing signs in your early stages of emotional and development that are commonly found in depression. These signs can be from the subtle to the severe. When we first start to experience emotions, the brain begins to torment us with memories about our past and our past behaviors. We begin to relive and reexperience the bad feelings of our past, focusing on the negative events of our life and those around us. The more we try to forget the past, the stronger the feelings are.
I would recommend taking a few of the depression screening tests on this website. I’d also read information on depression and various treatments available. You should be feeling good about your situation and be able to function in your life. If you are unable to function despite the emotional pain you are feeling, that is a sign of other issues needing attention.
If you are able to successfully function in life, that will be a good sign. If however, you are having difficulty with these emotional feelings awesomely, that’s a sign you are struggling with depression. The best treatment for that is prayer each day for a small amount of time until you feel better.</p>

I am not suffering from any physical disease (i.e., diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problem, cancer, etc).
What is my actual problem? What should I do? Is there any medication for me to treat these problems?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Although I cannot offer a diagnosis, from the list of symptoms you gave, it sounds like you could be suffering from depression. People who are depressed often experience changes in sleep and appetite, are tired, think negative thoughts and lose interest and enjoyment in activities. Your list highlights all of these and more.
Being depressed does hinder decision-making, but two years seems like an awfully long time to be living with the symptoms you described without finding out what you have. So I’m wondering if there may be something else going on with you. For some people, depression can serve as a way to avoid a particular outcome. In your case, it may be that these symptoms are preventing you from doing things you’d rather not do.
In the middle of your catalog of symptoms, you listed several things about being uncomfortable around people, wanting to be alone, and not being likely to get married or pursue a career. You also mentioned being sensitive to rejection. Given these things and your age, I’m wondering if you are having difficulty with the transition from young person to adult. In the United States, our cultural narrative dictates that we should figure out our romantic and vocational futures by the time we’re 30 years old. For those who have trouble with this or have different timelines, these expectations can be stifling and can lead to depression. This may not be an issue for you but it’s at least worth considering.

The good news about depression is that it is highly treatable in a variety of ways. Behaviorally, a cure for depression can be action. This means that you force yourself to do some of the things you don’t want to do and not rest on your laurels. There are a lot of cognitive-behavioral techniques that can help with combating negative thoughts and behaviors. These can be learned with the help of a mental health professional or, if you are highly motivated, with the aid of workbooks and good websites. Yes, there is medication for depression but I always recommend that it is used as a last resort. There’s no reason to risk side effects if you can alleviate symptoms using an easier way.
Whatever you decide to do, I encourage you to seek your answer soon. Two years is a long time to suffer especially when help is available. If depression has been your way of coping, then maybe it’s time to find a more positive way. It may be painful at first but at least there is the chance of a happier outcome.</p>

        <p>Your situation is not uncommon. Individuals with these conditions often have problems with the gastrointestinal tract (the large intestine) producing the upset stomach and other bowel problems. With the exception of ulcerative colitis, these bowel problems are treated with a combination of medicines. I would recommend consulting your physician as soon as possible. The sooner you can begin treatment, the quicker your body can produce the results needed for your treatment.</p>

She has told me she is unhappy and does not love me the way she used too because of years of my not helping her with our three kids and the house chores and of my taking her for granted and disrespecting her in front of her mom. We have been separated for 12 days now and when I left she said she wanted to get back with a clean slate but did not give me any time table and she acts really nonchalant about the situation she said she needs time to see what she wants. How do I handle the situation? It’s driving me crazy. I want to be with her and have already changed for the better. PLEASE HELP!</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Wife of five years, three children, and you’re not helping. There’s a good chance she is emotionally exhausted and even depressed. It’s likely that you’ve been placed on probation to see if you’re capable of changing — not only in your behavior but in your understanding of the situation. A change in your behavior won’t improve this situation. You can make a teenager wash his car by threatening him/her — but what you need is that they understand the need to wash the car, take care of their possessions, and help the family with chores. To keep your wife you need to demonstrate a change in your understanding of her immense pressures, responsibilities, and obligations. Keep in mind, if you’re not helping — she’s caring for four children. 
Disrespecting her in front of her mother is likely the tip of the iceberg. I’d bet you’ve not only disrespected her, but not respected her contribution to your life. She’s feeling taken totally for granted. You’ll need to acknowledge that you two are partners in life — it’s the two of you against the world so to speak. You must operate as a mutually-supportive team in all situations, including the presence of relatives. 
Marital counseling would be helpful. If you’re 37 y/o and just now have three very young children, I would imagine that you’ve lived independently to the point that you may not know how to acknowledge her contributions or act as a team player. I bet she would describe you as living your own lifestyle independent of the family. If so, that behavior will cost you your marriage. 
Sit with her and ask her how to customize your behavior and the marriage. Remember…this is your partner in life. It’s not a pride issue, not a competition, and not something to be sensitive about. It’s something to fix.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>When we have a history of significant problems, it’ll take a lot of time, effort, and maturity to change our behavior and to follow through with any program we’ve developed. It‘s normal to have concerns and even “trigger events” in our past that we can’t quite get past. In these situations, it often takes a “cure” or a ‘cure plus’ to get past the bad memories. Cures are often alcohol, drugs, or other drugs that we use to temporarily forget about the problems we had in the past. Curing is a process that involves working with a trained professional to identify the actual problem behaviors and to commit the proper response to them. Sometimes, a visit to a counselor or therapist can be helpful in providing some tools and techniques to help us “clean up” our past and to give ourselves a chance to regain a sense of control over our impulses and to actually make a difference in the lives of those around us.</p>

I really enjoy meeting people and conversing with them but can’t seem to “get a word into” the discussion because it seems I’m thinking really slowly or something. So, I just become a kind of spectator or something, and my mind goes blank or I get stuck. It doesn’t feel like I’m getting nervous or anything like that. It’s just that my mind can’t keep up and sometimes goes completely blank. Other people seem to think of jokes and fun comments all the time and respond in milliseconds. I never manage to do this (which means I can’t talk to women at all, since they want fun and interesting conversation). It has a very bad effect on my social life, and I have very few friends (no female ones), and I’m starting to feel depressed.
It’s been like this as far as I can remember. Does this sound like a disorder or anything like that to you?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>There is no official diagnosis for what some clinicians prefer to label a “cognitive processing speed” disorder or disability. The fact is, however, that some people simply have a hard time processing information, responding to it, or initiating actions or conversation rapidly. In some individuals this difficulty is more pronounced in certain situations. They might be very “quick” to process some kinds of material and still have a very difficult time in other situations. These kinds of situations are very different from those that arise out of excessive anxiety, although it’s not uncommon for individuals who have processing speed problems to suffer some degree of anxiety as a result.
There are some intervention strategies that can help an individual improve his or her mental processing speed. The interventions are generally crafted to the particular kinds of situations and tasks that are a problem for the slower processor and can include medications to help increase attentional focus, strategies to improve learning speed, and a variety of other techniques. Best to visit with a professional who specializes in helping individuals overcome cognitive disabilities.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>From your description, you are experiencing a clinical depression. This type of depression is gradual onset (not a reaction to a single bad event) and it can be incapacitating. It can be very debilitating because it immobilizes you and makes you unable to function in social settings. 
I“m” assuming you are receiving treatment for this depression. Treatment for depression is often difficult because there are so many possible causes of the problem — some of which are difficult to treat. I would recommend discussing this in your relationship counselor or your family physician. Treatment is often complicated because of the unique nature of the situation. For example, you mention that you can‘t’ talk to others at all — that’ll take some getting used to. Treatment will address the “joke” problem, allowing you to talk more slowly and more easily with others.  When you feel better, talk to friends and family. aintain a routine — eat well, exercise, study and study. This will help you feel more confident in social interactions and will also help you maintain a healthy level of self-confidence.  
The good news is that with treatment you can achieve a level of conversational communication that will allow you to eventually talk to people at a higher level than before. For people who are experiencing depression, it’S helps them to be more aware of their physical state and to have a sense of humor. This</p>

We had decided that when I am feeling insecure or unsure of his truthfulness I would ask him directly about what I was feeling uncomfortable or doubtful about and we would discuss the issue right then. This doesn’t work because he becomes angry and now violent. He says he is at the end of his rope. I do not question him all the time, not once a week or month for that matter. However, when I feel like he isn’t being honest with me I will let him know I am having some difficulty with what he is saying to me.
My question is, “Should he have tolerance with my doubts until there comes a time when I feel secure and re-assured or should I just simply believe everything without question and get over it?”</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>This situation creates a cycle that just gets worse. He lies and you question him. He becomes angry and defensive, and as you mention, violent in his reaction. His reaction makes you more hesitant to ask him for reassurance yet you remain unsure and your tension builds. Finally, you ask for assurance again and he explodes and the cycle begins again. 
There are so many issues here. Is he still doing things that make you feel he is lying? If he’s not, then he probably feels you are not forgiving him and will continue to question him, no matter what he does. Both of you are probably frustrated that those original discussions didn’t solve the situation. From his view, the original situation is over but from your standpoint, you now worry and question what other lies may have been told. It a way, the trust foundation of your relationship has been damaged. 
It’s often helpful to focus on the positive and negative of the situation, not the individual. In this way, when he does things that make you feel secure, tell him so. If he calls you from an out-of-town meeting, let him know that the call is helpful and positive. If we only discuss issues when they are negative, the trust will only deteriorate.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>There are two issues here. The first issue is whether your husband is comfortable lying to you. If he is lying to minimize your discomfort, then that may be a problem. The second issue is, is there a reason for his lying. Generally, when someone is feeling insecure about something, there is a reason behind it.
If you are unsure about a relationship, questioning the nature of a relationship is one of the first things to go about. If your husband lies to you, even to a point of not telling you why, then there is probably a reason. However however, if you are uncomfortable with his honesty, then questioning his honesty is not going to be very productive.
It sounds like you trust your husband to be honest with you. You don’T trust him to be truthful. That is not a good reason to have doubts, and the violence he is doing is a problem to you as well. However, if you cannot trust him, then I would not worry about getting over it. As for the violent behavior, there may be reasons behind it but I doubt they have to do with honesty. If the reason is honest, then simply believing everything he says is not productive. I would think that if you could somehow work out a solution with him that would be more productive. If honesty is involved, then the violence would cease. However it does sound like the sooner the better.

If your husband cannot be honest, or if his honesty causes you to question him, simply believing him is not enough. A relationship is a relationship between two people. If you cannot be trusted to be trusted or to be loyal, then working together as a team is not likely to be fruitful.</p>

        <p>You’ve had so many recent changes — deciding to leave your faith, ending your relationship with your long-time girlfriend, pulling away from friends — it is no wonder that you are feeling lost and ungrounded. Many of the things that anchored you over the years are now gone, and you’re questioning your beliefs, values and directions in life.
One exercise that can be helpful when going through a time of transition that has left one questioning values, beliefs and how to authentically live one’s life is to imagine yourself at your 75th birthday party. A loved one is about to stand up and give a brief speech celebrating your life. What would you hope that loved one would say? People often hope that they would be known as a good parent, a loving partner, a caring friend, a dedicated volunteer, or a success in their career due to their strong work ethic. Focusing on these identities can be a way of grounding yourself in your values and life goals so that you can then build an authentic life by making valued choices.
It can be hard to sort out such weighty issues in a vacuum. Consider reconnecting with a trusted friend, family member or respected member of your network, such as an accepting elder from your faith community. A therapist may also be able to help you sort through your thoughts and help you identify and connect with your value system.
Best of luck to you as you focus on discovering yourself and work towards living a life consistent with your beliefs and values. While this period of transition may be uncomfortable at times, I hope you will find it to be a period of growth and discovery.</p>

        <p>You already seem to have an idea about what your problem is. You say that drinking has been a bad influence on your life and that it has affected your ability to trust and be honest with others. You also say that despite the fact that alcohol has not been a major influence on you, you still feel that way and think that it will “not be a problem” when you stop drinking.
It seems reasonable to ask what you need and what you will take from this. Alcoholism is a problem in itself and not related to any one religious belief system or philosophy. There are numerous possible reasons for this, but it certainly does not excuse the inability to stop drinking and to stop abusing alcohol.
Some people (e.g., family, friends, etc.) who have alcohol problems stop drinking when they find that it does not help them. Some do not abuse alcohol at all and continue to abuse it. Alcohol abuse is a serious problem in its own right. People abusing alcohol do not think that drinking stops the abuse, but rather the inability of the brain to stop thinking about alcohol. There is no magic antidote for this problem. It only works if the person understands that they need</p>

        <p>The teen years is a very difficult time for many youth. They are in the process of establishing their identity and comparing that identity with their parents and their peers. Teens often seek support for their current identity in other peer groups, producing most of the groups we see in high schools such as gothic, jocks, skateboarders, etc. Emo is a group that emphasizes and amplifies the feelings of alienation and emotional misery experienced by many teens. It also supports confusion around sexual identity, relationships with adults/peers, and depression. A depressed and alienated teen often slips into an Emo or Gothic subculture, finding other teens who are also depressed, confused, alienated, and distressed. Sadly, the type of emotional support provided by these groups actually prolongs their emotional misery by encouraging further alienation. 
There’s a good possibility that she is experiencing a depression. As a supporting adult, I would recommend focusing on her feelings of depression, her emotional pain, and other depressive symptoms. Focusing on Emo is probably a bad idea as that group emphasizes alienation rather than returning to a normal, healthy lifestyle. If an adult drinks too much because they’re depressed, focusing on their drinking misses the point. 
Discuss with her how adults experience the same symptoms — escape fantasies, confusion, concentration problems, etc. Talk about what adults do during these times (seek advice from experts, try to avoid more problems, etc.). Mention that 15% of her freshman class probably won’t make it to graduation as they become side-tracked by emotional problems, drugs/alcohol, pregnancy, “fads”, etc. Encourage her to enlist the help of her parents to obtain mental health treatment and to address these issues. This is a very difficult passage for this teen and she will need adult and family guidance rather than Internet confusion.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>As I mention in my article on Emotional Memory, there is a region of the brain called the hippocampus that appears particularly involved in the development of Emotional Memories. This region contains memories that contain both the details of an experience and the mood that was present at the time. When we recall an Emotional memory, we first think of the mood and the emotions at the scene. From that point, we then think of things to say and do. As an example, when watching a movie, we can recall the faces of our friends and family as they smile or nod when watching the movie. We can also recall the songs they play when they walk or sit near us.  (Note: This region of our brain is also located in the frontal lobe of the hippocampus, just under the cerebral brain. The Emotional Network is a pathway and richly involved in depression and anxiety disorders.
When a young adult confides in you about their recent breakup, that region of their brain contains not only the details about the breakup, but the mood as well. They begin to discuss their feelings, talk about them, and view them as if they were watching a TV program or some other form of entertainment. They become apprehensive and anxious, often fearful that their personal situation will change for the worse once the Emotionalmemory is triggered. As you observed, the more we think and react emotionally, the stronger the feelings and thoughts become. This creates a very interesting situation. When this happens, they begin to fear their worst fears, thoughts of loss, self-doubt, and distressed mood</p>

My daughter took several tests and she was diagnosed with this. Right now it’s affecting her schooling; she’s constantly depressed and cries a lot. She is 19. I would love to help but don’t know where to turn.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Schizoaffective disorder involves the combination of schizophrenia and an affective (mood) disorder, such as depression or bipolar disorder. Unfortunately, as with all of the emotional and mental disorders, there are no laboratory tests used to diagnose or confirm the presence of a disorder. I suspect that the type of test you’re referring to might be a self-report test that perhaps your daughter found online. Those types of assessments are meant to screen for the possibility of a disorder, but there are many reasons why such tests are unreliable and meant as only crude indicators of whether to seek professional assessment.
Mental health professionals typically rely on self-reported symptoms to form a diagnosis. However, in asking questions they can clarify and explore the patient’s experiences, and gauge the severity of the symptoms being reported; online or printed tests cannot. So, some people may respond to printed questions in ways that add to a score indicating a possible mental health problem simply because of the ways they’re interpreting what is being asked, or what the response choices mean.
Then there is the issue of overlap among psychiatric symptoms. Several different diagnoses may all include some aspects of the experiences your daughter is having. For example, whereas schizophrenia includes hallucinations (false sensory experiences) and delusions (false beliefs), severe depression sometimes also includes these same extreme symptoms. Mood problems, such as depression and anxiety, are common to multiple psychiatric diagnoses.
Because of the messiness of psychiatric diagnoses, it’s important that your daughter be evaluated by a qualified mental health professional. Precise diagnosis is often difficult (and sometimes impossible), but it is important to know whether your daughter is experiencing some symptoms indicating schizophrenia. The medications used to treat depressed mood are of a different type than those used to treat psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, that are not caused by the depression. For illnesses such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, medications are the first necessary step, which will require prescriptions from a medical doctor. Because psychiatry is the medical specialty that’s most relevant, I encourage you to help your daughter make and keep an appointment with a psychiatrist. If she has been diagnosed by a mental health professional, that person should have recommended or offered treatment options. If not, it’s time to try again.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>There are several treatments available for Schizoaffirmative Disorder. In research, we do studies using various medications at various levels of effectiveness. In the general population, about 40% of people with Schizoafective Disorder use antidepressant medications. In children, the medication typically works in the general adult population, but it is used in children as well.
The remaining 40% use anti-depressants and/or antianxiety medications. Antianxiety medication is used for the short-term to control the depressive symptoms, while anti-psychotic medications are used for longer-term treatment.
When it comes to treatment, there are several options. In large measure, Schizoamine treatment is the treatment of choice for individuals who live in the United States. In small measure, psychotherapy or counseling is also very effective, especially for individuals whose physical manifestations of Schizoappears are larger than those of schizophrenia. The major treatment considerations are:
In cases of Schizophrenia, it‘usually’ll work to reduce the depressive and anxiety symptoms. If that’ s not possible, then psychotherapy would probably be the next best choice. The reason, however, is that many medications for Schizophrenic Disorder don‘t target the “big picture” issues that often surface when someone with the disorder has physical manifestations that are difficult to control. For this reason, treatment for Schizotypal Disorder often includes medications for physical manifestations as well as cognitive and behavioral manifestations of the disorder.
You might want to read my article on Chemical Imbalance on my website at www.drjoecarver.com. It describes the current treatment model for Schifizoafflictive Disorder. It would also be helpful to consult with a psychiatrist who is familiar with the medications and techniques used to manage the symptoms.</p>

I knew I didn’t need this medicine anymore and just stopped taking them. I did my research and knew of some of the side effects that can happen when someone stops taking an antidepressant like Effexor, so I monitored my behavior very closely. The only side effect was some dizziness. Please allow me to state that if I “started” to feel, act and/or behave strangely, I would have gone to a doctor ASAP! Understanding the source of my depression and learning to manage it help me greatly, and I felt that this antidepressant wasn’t doing any good for me. In fact I felt that Effexor was only interfering with my healing (emotional/mental) progress. I guess my question is why did I have few or no withdrawal symptoms from this drug (having heard so many “horror stories” about some people who stop taking antidepressants). I also want to state that this was my decision and would never advise anyone to do this. Also, I have heard about people getting “hooked” on antidepressants. Is this really possible?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Side effects, withdrawal syndromes (what happens when you stop the medication), and issues related to dependency upon the medication, are all typically dose-related. The higher the dose, the more likely you will experience side effects and withdrawal symptoms. In my experience, people don’t become “hooked” or addicted to antidepressants, although they can become addicted to antianxiety medications. It is possible to become dependent upon medications, a condition in which the medication is needed or side effects emerge. 
Your dose of Effexor was actually a “starter dose” at 37.5 mg. As the dose was low, the side effects and withdrawal reactions would also have been minimal. You did mention some very important points, however. We should never withdraw from medications without the approval of our prescribing physician and/or psychiatrist. It’s also important to contact our prescribing physician when any unusual side effects or reactions occur. It’s important to remember that all medications should be monitored and controlled by our physician. We should not change the dosage, frequency, times we take the medications, or what other medications we also use without the approval of our physician.</p>

        <p>There are many possible reasons for the lack of behavioral or physical symptoms associated with stopping an antidepressant medication. The most common reason for such a situation is a medication side effect. Many medications have a “hit or miss” reaction in the treatment process. If the antidepressant is a ‘starter drug’, many people will experience some withdrawal symptoms first, especially if it’s been used for a long time. If it‘seems like the antidepressant isn’ t working well for you, many folks return to the medication at a later date.
There is also a possibility that your antidepressant medication may be causing you to have inconsistent or even negative side effects. The nature of this depends upon several factors.
Most likely, you’re experiencing a ”typical “drug side effect” in your case. Medications can have a number of side effects, most of which are relatively routine and occur without a major issue. Most folks experience a combination of anxiety and depression symptoms, with some of them lasting for months. If you‘start out’ve not feeling well,’ that’ll be the time to consult with a physician and have the antidepressant evaluated. The best way to do that is with a professional psychiatrist who has experience with both a and bionic injury prevention medications.

You might also have other psychological reasons for not feeling good about taking the medication</p>

Is this common in depressed individuals or might it indicate a different disorder (e.g., psychosis, schizophrenia)? I do not take any medications.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Emotional distress is not only an emotional event in our lives, but a chemical event as well. Emotional distress changes our neurochemistry and body chemistry. Sometimes those chemical changes create muscle tension as when a person is so stressed that their neck is stiff or they develop muscle cramps. Common physical manifestations of stress include twitching muscles below the eyes for example.
You are likely describing a type of stress-produced TMD or “TemporoMandibular Disorder”. We all have heard of people who become so angry that they clinch their teeth. This works the same way. Your emotional distress may activate jaw movement similar to folks who grind their teeth at night when stressed. Some people under stress get tension headaches, some eye twitches, some chest pain…and you — jaw movements. It’s probably a good indication that your level of emotional distress is beyond just crying spells. You may be moving into a clinical depression with anxiety/agitation. I would recommend consulting your physician as a starting point. “Frequent” crying spells tells me you may benefit from an antidepressant medication and perhaps a long-acting anxiety medication. It’s not psychosis/schizophrenia but when TMDs are produced by your level of distress, it’s a clear sign that the level of emotional distress is becoming clinically significant and requires treatment. You might also consider learning and practicing relaxation techniques as well as stress-reduction strategies.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>It’s not uncommon for individuals who are experiencing frequent and involuntary jaw chomps to have several episodes of what I call “subclinical tics” — in which the jaw movements are involuntary, occur before the eyes are normally open, and occur without a clear cause. These episodes can be caused by a variety of conditions including:
It‘s’ likely that your episodes of jaw chompering are related to stress and depression. If you have been under a high level of stress for a prolonged period of time, as when being on medication, the jaw may have started to chomper. This may also be a type of stress-produced tic.
It also doesn’t sound like subclinical tic behavior as such, as the movements you report. If this is the case, you may be experiencing the stress of not being able to sleep well or have a high blood pressure. The combination of sleep problems and jaw chattering may be the cause of your episodes.
If you are experiencing the jaw choming, I would recommend a sleep study to determine if the problem is sleep apnea or another cause. If the episodes occur without frequent and voluntary movement of the jaw, I might suggest a sleep assessment as well. If there are multiple causes, a sleep examination may be needed as well, although a few of the possible causes may be involved in that as well — such as:

We have been married 27 years. I am at a loss as to what I need to do. There is so much at stake and she dosen’t seem to care. I still love her but I can no longer do nothing.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Your wife may be having problems with both alcoholism and depression. This is a very destructive combination. The first thing to do is find out what resources are available in your community. Most communities have a drug/alcohol program — some attached to the mental health center or hospital and some non-medical such as AA. Some of these programs offer interventions and consultation with the family. Family members can also seek support from local AA groups who offer programs for family members who are dealing with someone in the family with drinking problems. 
Help often comes from difficult situations. If she has another DUI, for example, she might be court-ordered to alcohol treatment. If she is arrested, she may come into contact with alcohol or mental health treatment professionals. There are some times that the family may need to create a confrontation, bringing her alcohol problems to her attention. Keep in mind, she has a lot of reasons that she drinks, she feels entitled to drink, and she feels she has the situation under control. For this reason, confrontations are not easy and denial of a problem is common. If you decide on a confrontation or ultimatum, be sure to have a follow-up plan that includes alcohol treatment and mental health treatment. Confrontations are generally useless if the group has no positive alternatives. You must have answers to questions such as “Ok, I have a drinking problem. What can I do?”</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>First let me offer you my congratulations on your marriage and the new family. Alcoholism is a serious problem in its own right, but it is also a problem in our family. Here are some things you can do:
Your wife‘s “flingering for attention” is getting out of control. She needs to recognize that her behavior is getting drunker and drunker as her way of trying to get attention. This is not an emotional situation by patriotism, it is a legal requirement for women to be able to serve in the military. If she is not able to follow the legal guidelines for enlistment, she will be removed from the family home. This may include any divorce or annulment that may be imminent. 
You can’TALK TO her about your drinking problem. She may be embarrassed and feel bad about it. You can also tell her that you are available for support, but make clear your willingness to be a good husband and father.  (And remember: You can‘teach’ about alcoholism in the family. Don’ticucation is the key. If your wife is embarrassed or ashamed of her drinking, you can mention your support for her efforts to seek help. You don’tely mention your daughters, but mention that you’ll be there for them in a way. (It is very important that you show your love and support for your wife” without belittling her or her drinking problem — even when she is drinking. You’re there for her when she’is embarrassed or socially withdrawn. This will make her feel less “needy” and more “withdrawing.”</p>

I not only cannot remember my childhood but also anything else — my teen years, my friends in school, and even some of my adult life. I can remember a handful of events and names but that doesn’t seem normal to me. I am 32 and can’t remember my life. I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately and am growing concerned that I might have a problem that might need professional attention.</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Issues with memory are pretty complicated. For example, while you mention that you can’t remember your life — this is impossible. In truth, you are remembering your daily routine, where you live, your language (both written and speaking), ability to type and use the computer, etc. In this manner of thinking, your memory is working very well — otherwise you’d be totally lost everyday. 
What you are describing is difficulty with Memory Recall — the ability to purposefully recall specific memories or events in your past. We know your memory has been working, so recall is the major issue here. Some thoughts and impressions:

As you explore this issue, I would suggest:
I suspect your memories are still there but you may be trying to hard to recall them, creating anxiety that only makes recall more difficult.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>You don’T have a “normal” childhood — just a childhood. If we think about a normal childhood — it’s the one in which you were able to receive and maintain attention in school and interact with peers. If you had a very difficult childhood, the majority of your brain memorizes the events of our childhood — good and bad. The important thing is to have a normal memory — one that is easily refreshed. If your memory is not working as well as it should familiarize you with situations in your life, that is also a problem and can lead to problems in school.
You’ll find that a lot more people have difficulty remembering their childhood than are able to remember their adulthood. The reason is: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a real condition that can be reliably and effectively treated. In many cases, medication can also be helpful in reducing the stimulant-inflated brain activity. If medications are not working well, counseling/therapy is recommended to help you improve your memory and functioning.
If you are talking about a childhood in which your brain hasn’ticly tried to ignore all the bad memories, I would recommend a psychiatric consultation to sort out the issues. I would not recommend a childhood that is characterized by frequent thoughts of death, removal from parents, being abandoned by parents, etc. A psychiatrist is best trained to separate the good memories from the bad and often helps the patient remember the good times with positive memories.</p>

So, doc, what am I? Am I a psycho or some kind of schizo? Or am I just a regular teenager?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Some of these symptoms are fairly common in teenagers…but hallucinations are not. “Voices” are an indication that your brain chemistry is changing and in the current theory, that the neurotransmitter Dopamine is slowly increasing. When Dopamine starts overproducing in the brain, we first feel somewhat “wired” and agitated. We next become suspicious and seem to find special meaning in patterns or things we experience in the environment — e.g., we feel that certain numbers are appearing on purpose or that people are spreading rumors about us. Then a weird kind of sense develops: while our emotional responsiveness decreases, we get a feeling of grandiosity at the same time — as though we have special skills or a special destiny. It’s a weird sense of “I feel like I’m a genius but I don’t emotionally feel anything special about that fact”. 

What slowly emerges next are auditory hallucinations — at first they sound like mumbling. As they continue, the “voices” become clearer and often talk about sex or religion. The voices can be saying good or bad things about you. It’s at about this time that we have difficulty sensing our environment, as though things are unreal. From there we develop some strange ideas in an attempt to explain our situation — that maybe my experience is being controlled by an outside force/agency or that I’m in a computer matrix. 
All that said, if you’re experiencing most of what I’ve described, it’s very important that you seek mental health evaluation. These changes in neurotransmitter levels can occur naturally or due to medication we take or other factors. It’s important to seek treatment as early as possible. You can also read more about this on my website at www.drjoecarver.com where I would recommend reading the article on Chemical Imbalance. While many of your symptoms are typically teenager — others are moving in a very serious direction that will require medical and psychiatric attention.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>You’re a 16-year-old professional who is involved in a program to provide mental health services to children. As part of the program, you are also providing services to adults with a diagnosis of ADHD (ADHD) and is seeking guidance on how to meet and deal with the symptoms of ADHD.
You‘re dealing with two very different issues. The first issue involves the fact that you are a professional who provides services to teenagers. You also provide services to your peers at school and in your community. The second issue has to do with the nature and severity of your disorder (schizoaffective disorder). In a way, you’ve created a situation where the professional services you provide are effectively a form of child support.
When you provide services — you are not just providing services but you are creating a situation in which the services are very limited and the quality of the services is substandard. The best way to provide quality mental health care to your community is to make your community a better place for your people. Your community can thank you for this.
So what are you? A professional, a schizoafficion, or a teenager?
You are not a psycho and you are doing what is best for you. I would recommend consulting a psychiatrist or at a minimum a psychologist. As a nonphysician, I can’t offer any treatment recommendations other than what is already provided.</p>

I live about 50 miles away. I’ve had no problem going up there to visit. The problem is my parents and I would like to have her to ourselves to be able to create memories with her and spend alone time with her. Mom says no because it causes too much stress on her and that her memory isn’t developed enough yet anyway. What we ask is when they come down for a doctor’s appointment, bring her over for an hour or two. They only come down twice a month, if that. I know there is some substance to this but is it enough for us to not be able to spend that kind of time with her?</p>
        <h3>Ground-truth (Psychologist Expert Note):</h3>
        <p>Memories and parental bonding are a two-way street. While your daughter may have no future recollection of your visits at the age of three months — you will have those memories. You have a right to make memories of your daughter’s infancy — memories for you to keep. Traveling with infants is very stressful but as times passes, I would encourage you to establish scheduled visitation with your daughter if allowed by the courts. I don’t know of many mothers who would leave their 3 month-old child with anyone for an extended period. If you make the visitations pleasant and the child’s mother feels comfortable, contact times with the child can be increased. This will be a slow process. 
It’s often helpful to establish a communication link with the mother — related only to the child. If the mother has email, for example, you might purchase and give her a digital camera, encouraging her to take frequent pictures of the child and send them to you. The best possible situation for the child is when you and her mother have a good, working relationship.</p>
        <h3>'Prediction Model:'</h3>
        <p>There is substance to what you’re saying. There’ll be a problem if you bring your daughter to a doctor for the purpose of creating memories — not enough, not too much, not even a lot. The issue isn‘the substance’.
From your description, I don’T sense a problem.
There’S ‘something’ wrong with your parents. They won’’
t agree to see the doctor for a psychological evaluation unless there’ s a clear medical reason for them not to see it. They may agree to go if the psychologist provides them with a prescription for the drug they want. In that case, they would need to see you first before they could make a decision about whether to prescribe.
The problem isn“the substance.” There is a problem with your mother’daddy. There is nothing you can do about the situation other than “move on.’ You didn’ t create the situation, her family didn‘t create the relationship, and the doctor‘prescribing’ is only an opportunity for the psychologist to obtain information about you, your history, and her personality. The psychologist may ask about your relationship with your mom, what’ends up in her life, etc. If you can’r bring something positive to the table, the psychologist may be interested.
If you move on, your mother will be remembered as a fond memory — not a troubled soul. I ditched my son after 2 years because I couldn’te handle the emotional distress created by his presence in my life. My mother doesn’ticulately visits the doctor — not me. I don…t know what to do.</p>
